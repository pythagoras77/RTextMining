1. INTRODUCTION
This document is to be read alongside the substantive 2017-2020 Plan and demonstrates progress against a range of priorities and developments of service delivery in line with local and national agendas.
In terms of current demographics, Nottingham continues to face significant challenges, with a rising population. Nottingham City has 67,900 children and young people under the age of 18. Deprivation affects a significant number of families in Nottingham, which is the eighth most deprived LA according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation, but is the fourth most deprived for children according to the Income Depravation Affecting Children Index, meaning that we are the most deprived among our statistical neighbour group and core cities comparators. 
* Core Cities:		Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Newcastle upon Tyne, Cardiff

* YJS Family: 			Manchester, Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Southampton, Bristol, Coventry, Birmingham, Salford,

* Statistical Neighbours: 	Southampton, Kingston upon Hull, Manchester, Bristol, Coventry, Salford, Derby, Birmingham, Sandwell, Wolverhampton

42,000 Nottingham City children live in families where no adults work or where the household income is low. This is equivalent to 64.8% of children, compared to rates of 48% in Greater Nottingham and 43% in England. 
The population of pupils in the City's educational provision also shows a changing picture of language and ethnicity, 54.7% of pupils being members of BAME groups in January 2017. This proportion has been rising in recent years from 37% in 2008. 31.1% of all pupils have a first language that is not English. This has risen from 18% in 2008 and is expected to increase further. International migration is one of the key reasons for the population growth.
Within the 2018/19 updated Youth Justice Plan, development of the service in line with the emerging safeguarding issues facing children and young people at risk of entering and involved in the criminal justice system was outlined.
Our response to complex, contextual and more recently, transitional safeguarding has now been strengthened by the development from October 2018 of a whole City approach to tackling serious youth violence, along a 'public health model'.  The drivers for change occurred at the most senior political, Local Authority and policing level. Council officers across our Directorate and that of Community Protection were challenged to develop and realign resource to reduce the risk and impact of serious violence in relation to children and young people, as perpetrators and victims.
This work has run alongside the focus of the Police and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner's (OPCC) launch of Nottinghamshire's 'Knife Crime Strategy' in October 2018. 
Adopting a systemic 'public health' approach to tackling the causative factors of youth violence supports our focus as an 'Early Intervention' City. The programme is split into two phases-
Phase One - Development of a responsive, deployable and flexible resource through a multi-agency Exploitation and Violence Reduction (EVR) Hub. 
Phase Two - a systemic 'public health' approach to tackling the causative factors. 

The EVR Hub comprises a range of skills and resources, as well as seeking partner support to develop a model that addresses the harm caused by, and to, young adults as well as children and includes specialist targeted youth support and youth workers, whole family, mental health  and safeguarding practitioners and Community Cohesion, Employment and Community Protection resource.  This is done by identifying those at risk of being involved in violence, who are not currently subject to statutory work; there can be a creative and responsive deployment of a range of skills and resource to divert young people from negative and harmful lifestyles and support families and communities to be safer.  Further detail on the development of the 'EVR Hub' is provided later in the plan.
Given the complex governance environment and the range of Management Boards with an 'interest' in the serious youth violence (SYV) agenda, Nottingham has recently formed a SYV and Exploitation Strategic Programme Board, chaired by the Leader of the Council and Portfolio Holder for Children's Services, to reduce risks in relation to consistency and duplication of reporting. (See the proposed governance on p.5). 
Nottingham City has also continued to demonstrate significant and sustained progress on the Troubled Families Programme and is on target in both the number of families attached to the programme and the proportion of families achieving positive outcomes (conversion rate between attachment and PBR at end of 18/19 was 84%).  As oversight of the operational delivery of the programme (known locally as Priority Families) is with the Head of Youth Justice, we continue to maximise opportunities to drive a whole family approach to reducing serious youth violence.




PROPOSED GOVERNANCE


2 STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE

Since the strategy to integrate all elements of Children's Services was outlined in the 2017-20 YJS plan, the YJS has continued to demonstrate its aptitude for integrated and collaborative partnership work in line with Nottingham's 'whole family' approach, the reduction of unnecessary barriers between services and in tune with the YJB's 'child first, offender second' focus. 
At an operational level, the development of the Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) Panel and the EVR Hub to address SYV is tangible evidence of the ongoing partnership work in the YJS and its stronger position at the heart of Nottingham's children's service delivery for young people at risk of offending. In response to the undoubted trauma experienced by children and young people in their life journey and entry into the Youth Justice System, the YJS has also led on the development of a trauma informed approach to engage, assess and supervise young people. Nottingham was invited to be part of the YJB Serious Violence Reference Group and has been an active member of that forum. We also received additional YJB funding that was used to provide clinical supervision to all frontline staff. This is to ensure all frontline and leadership staff are being effectively supported and in acknowledgement of the impact of vicarious trauma on staff who are exposed to traumatic events emanating from SYV. Both of the aforementioned are being rolled out across the wider Directorate.
Additionally, the YJS has supported the Directorate to develop appropriate Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) aware communication material for children and young people, particularly children in the care of the Local Authority. 
Within the YJS leadership, there have been some changes in personnel. The Performance and Early Intervention Manager post has been deleted following the retirement of the post-holder in July 2018. In January 2019, the current Service Manager was successful in the recruitment process to the post of Acting (joint) Head of Service (HoS) for Early Help, (2.5 days per week), job-share role, following the retirement of previous post-holder. 
The HoS for Early Help oversees CAMHS, Priority Families/FIP, Children's Centres, Play and Youth and the Youth Justice Service. Over the past eighteen months, a considerable amount of work has been undertaken to ensure that the YJS and the Play and Youth service are closely aligned. This was to ensure we are delivering targeted interventions and services for those young people at risk of offending and in need of positive diversionary activities. The 'whole family' ethos of Early Help is supported by the work of Priority Families/Family Intervention Project and enables the YJS to access appropriate resources and support for whole family and parenting concerns. The presence of CAMHS within the Directorate also supports strategic and operational development to maximising all young people in the YJS being able to access appropriate services that support their emotional wellbeing and mental health promptly.  
To ensure resilience in the leadership team, an Operational Manager post was created to manage elements of the Performance and Early Intervention role and elements from the previous Operational Manager, post which had previously been strengthened to become a Service Manager post. Recently, the YJS has also recruited a full-time Practice Specialist to support the work of the South Team (the Practice Specialist had reduced to 2.5 days / week) and oversee practice development in the Court arena. There are also plans in place to strengthen the Leadership team further, by reviewing the roles and job descriptions. This will provide additional resilience, by giving greater responsibility and accountability to members of the leadership team. All staffing changes have been managed within the current budget, without putting staff 'at risk of redundancy' and thereby avoiding destabilising the wider workforce. 
To ensure there remains an emphasis on youth crime prevention and early intervention, particularly given the rise in knife crime, county lines and SYV in general, the Targeted Youth Support Workers and the Team Manager have become the main components of the newly developed EVR Hub. The EVR Hub started in October 2018 and has been developed incrementally over the last 9 months. A diverse group of voluntary, statutory and community partners all involved in delivering children's service attended its official launch at the National Justice Museum. 
At a Board level, work has begun to drive a more transparent governance to involve frontline practice and incorporate the views of children, families and communities in service delivery. The Board undertook a self-assessment at a YJB led 'workshop' around governance and National Standards and had an input into the recent YJS' whole Service Day. This year the terms of reference will be refreshed and an action plan is being devised to drive Board activity in line with recognised best practice.  
Despite rigorous efforts to retain the representation of the judicial system on the Board, due to further regionalisation, we have lost our Chief Clerk to Justices representative.  Our Board Chair has driven our request for a member of the judiciary to be part of the Board, but this has not yet come to fruition. However, we do now have the HoS for Inclusion (Education) on the Board to recognise the critical factor of ETE in outcomes for our cohort of children.

The reduction essentially amounts to 0.6% on last year's allocation. There have been no further reductions from partner agencies.  
Whilst there have been no wholesale restructure of staffing arrangements, there has been considerable challenge to manage workload due to some long-term sickness and maternity cover. Currently two members of staff are on maternity leave, another Case manager has recently left to take up another post and one other Case manager will be retiring in the coming weeks. To manage the aforementioned, we have recently recruited two new Case Managers, one permanent and one on a fixed term contract.  One Case Manager seconded elsewhere in the directorate as part of savings for last year has also recently returned to the Service. 
The development of the EVR Hub and its staffing requirements has also proven to be a challenge on budget resources. However, this has been managed within the current constraints. 
 




4 RISKS TO FUTURE DELIVERY AGAINST THE YOUTH JUSTICE OUTCOME MEASURES
4.1 Rate of proven reoffending by young people who offend

In 2017-18, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) changed the way that reoffending rates are calculated.  These are now based on the cohort of offenders in a 3-month period rather than 12 months.  This was done to reduce the delay in publishing reoffending figures from 33 to 24 months.  The impact of this is that the cohorts are much smaller and the rates are subject to much greater fluctuations.

Table 2: Re-offending after 12 months (MoJ data from PNC)
 
Table 2 YearAverage number of re-offencesAverage number of re-offences per reoffenderPercentage of cohort reoffendingNottingham (reported last year)Apr 16-Jun 161.944.0048.5Nottingham
 (latest data)Apr 17-Jun 171.543.7441.1Nottingham (local data)*Apr 17-Jun 171.293.6235.8Latest YJS family Average Apr 17-Jun 171.604.7637.5Latest Core City AverageApr 17-Jun 171.464.0336.1Latest SN AverageApr 17-Jun 171.714.5837.4Latest national average Apr 17-Jun 171.594.1338.4									All figures from MoJ except * - taken from CareWorks

Table 2 shows the latest verified data from the MoJ for the cohort of offenders who had a disposal in the 3 months up to June 2017, and measures their reoffending in the following 12 months up to June 2018.  As a comparison, the locally calculated figure has been added to the table.  This figure is important as it is based on 10-17 year olds who live in Nottingham City whereas the MoJ data uses the most recently recorded address which includes the address of the offence and the address of the arresting officer's HQ.
The MoJ figures show much lower rates of reoffending across the three measures than last year. Significantly, it is also below the figures that were recorded previous to last year. The average number of re-offences and average number of re-offences per offender is also lower than the YJS Family Average and the National Average.
The YJS Principal Analyst has continued to review and refine the suite of reports that he has developed to support the work of Case Managers, Practice Specialist, Team Managers and partners. This has afforded front line staff better opportunities to identify reoffending concerns sooner and tailor intervention packages closer to individuals assessed needs and risk. The YJS has also continued to build on its relationship with voluntary and community partners to enable them to provide more bespoke interventions for children and young people and ensure young people are working with individuals from within their community who they recognise, can build relationships with and are signposted to more sustainable resources post their engagement with the YJS. 
4.2 Young people receiving a conviction in court who are sentenced to custody
 		
                        Table 3: Quarterly data 2015/16 to 2018/19 (YJS)

Use of CustodyQ1 15/16Q2 15/16Q3 15/16Q4 15/16Q1 16/17Q2 16/17Q3 16/17Q4 16/17Q1 17/18Q2 17/18Q3 17/18Q4 17/18Q1 18/19Q2 18/19Q3 18/19Q4 18/19Quarter26113765999688365Year22273222




Table 3 shows that there were 22 young people sentenced to custody in 2018/19. This represents a significant decrease from the numbers for the previous two years and matches the numbers for 2015/16. The Practice Specialists and wider leadership team continue to quality assure all pre-sentence reports to ensure custody is only used as a last resort, where risk cannot be managed in the community. Additionally the YJS continues to have the trust of the local judiciary when proposing appropriate non-custodial sentences for young people.
       Table 4: Comparative data 2012/13 to 2017/18 (PNC)

Rate per 1000 of       10-17 population2014 - 152015 - 162016 - 172017 - 182018 - 19Nottingham0.630.851.031.190.82Family0.830.850.840.820.74Core Cities0.870.800.770.670.69Stat.

However, the figure remains higher than those of the average for each of the comparator group and nearly three times the national average.
Further analysis has been done with these cases to examine the two separate issues of disproportionality and sentence length.
Disproportionality
Of the 22 young people subject to custodial outcomes in 2018/19, and compared with the population of Nottingham City, analysis shows that:  
* Significantly, young people from BAME backgrounds are almost three times more likely to have received a custodial outcome compared with young people from White British backgrounds.  
* The length of custodial outcome is roughly equal for young people from BAME backgrounds compared with those from White British backgrounds at roughly 39 months, an increase of 141% on the previous year.
* Young people from BAME backgrounds are less likely to receive custodial sentences for more serious offences (using offence gravity) than those from White British backgrounds but there are too few cases to measure if this is significant.
* 2 of the 22 young people that went to custody were female, both were BAME
* 1 in every 3 days spent in custody is for a weapon-related offence. This is the same for young people from BAME backgrounds as it is for those from White British backgrounds.


Sentence length
       Table 5: Average custodial sentence length: 2014/15 to 2018/19
Year2014-152015-162016-172017-182018-19Average sentence length (months)26.410.821.116.339.3

Table 5 shows that, over the past 5 years, average sentence length has varied between about 10 and 39 months. Last year's average of 39.3 months is exceptional. 
Bail and Remands
				     
Table 6: Bail and Remand by Outcome type: 2014/15 to 2018/19

Remand Type2014/152015/162016/172017/182018/19Bail Supervision and Support101761510Intensive Surveillance and Support133976Remand in Care168351YDA: Secure Children's Home44341YDA: Secure Training Centre232104YDA: Youth Offender Institute1012181421All remand/ intensive bail5546405843

Table 6 shows the number of remands and intensive bail packages for young people from Nottingham over the past 5 years. It shows that remands to Youth Detention Accommodation (Young Offender Institutions, Secure Training Centres and Secure Children's Homes) increased to 31 in 2017/18 before dipping again in 2018/19. The costs of these remands is borne by the Local Authority, and these vary depending on the type of placement identified. Currently, Secure Children's Homes and Secure Training Centre placements cost £699 (an increase of 21% on the previous year) and £612 (an increase of 14% on the previous year) per night respectively. Young Offender Institute placements are £240 per night, an increase of 26% on the previous year.  Placement allocation is determined by an assessment of the young person's safety and wellbeing and the availability of places, with the MoJ's Youth Custody Service Placement Team having ultimate responsibility for this decision. Clearly, overall costs are determined, not just by the number of placements themselves, but by the number of bed-nights at each of these placements: in 2016/17, the 23 placements were made up of 822 bed-nights, totalling £192,000; in 2018/19, the 26 placements consisted of almost 3000 bed-nights, totalling about £1.03 million, over 5 times as much. 
4.3 First-time entrants to the youth justice system aged 10-17

       Table 7: First-time Entrant's performance by quarters: 2014/15 to 2018/19

Table 7 shows that the number of first time entrants (FTEs) coming into the system in Nottingham continues to fall and has fallen considerably since 2014/15. In 2018/19, the number of FTEs had fallen by more than a third when compared the number of FTEs in 2014/15.

Using PNC data supplied by the YJB, table 8 shows that in terms of the first time entrant rate per 100,000 of the youth population, the number in Nottingham has clearly fallen in recent years, but this remains one of the highest rates in the country and currently twice the national average. As a result of this situation, in January 2018, the YJS Management Board facilitated a discussion with key partners to address this challenge. The Management Board recognised that the challenge of FTEs extends beyond just YJS activities and is affected by policing and a range of partner activities. 
After extensive discussions and planning, the YJS supported by the Police have implemented a Triage approach to assessing FTEs into the youth justice system. One of the main components of this new process has been the Police making changes to their cautioning approach and the YJS Out of Court Disposal (OoCD) panel, making proposals for intervention or referrals back to the arresting officer for charge, (see the following updated action plan for more).   








5   UPDATE ON ACTION PLAN 2017-20


AreaUpdateNational Standards * Addressing National Standards is a routine part of practice supervision and the Practice Specialist oversight of all case work, and is supported by data reporting from the Performance Analyst 
* The new YJB National Standards were agreed and set by the Secretary of State for Justice on 1 April 2019   
* In preparation for implementation period (September 2019 - April 2020), each of the 5 domains has been allocated to a designated lead within the YJS leadership team. This will support the YJS in examining how the YJS partnership, and external others, can work together to demonstrate that our service adheres to the National Standards and how this can be measured.
* The YJS Board has met to look at the impact the changes to National Standards will have in relation to governance arrangements and an action plan is being devised to be rolled out as part of the implementation period
* The YJS leadership team has worked with YJS practitioners at a YJS whole service day to ensure that they have an input into how the new National Standards are implemented. Quality Assurance and Management Oversight* The Quality Assurance and Performance framework has been updated to reflect the new HMIP inspection regime and to take account of the new National Standards framework. 
* Management oversight is a routine part of practice supervision and Practice Specialist oversight of all case work
* Practice oversight continues to be informed by Critical Learning Reviews, Serious Case Reviews and effective/good practice insight
* A member of the YJS leadership Team attends Nottingham City's Safeguarding Children's Boards Audit Group and Nottingham's Safeguarding Children's Board Quality Assurance Subgroup. Attendance at the safeguarding meeting garners partnership work, enables practice to be scrutinised, ensures expertise is shared, lessons learned and disseminated to the YJS and partners
* The Practice Specialist (North Team) attends regional effective practice meetings and cascades learning across the YJS. Prevent and Channel * The responsibility, accountability and Chair of the Channel Panel now sits with the HoS for Early Help (Nottingham City) and the Service Director and Caldicott Guardian - Children and Family Services (Nottinghamshire). 
* The Channel panel review was attended by the City and County Chair. This was the first of what will be an ongoing process in the future and arranged every six months across the region, with the intention to ensure that panels remain consistent, provides peer challenge, highlights good practice and celebrates success stories.
* Regular attendance by Nottinghamshire Adult Social Care has now been secured.
* The YJS continues to play an integral part in Channel with a Case Manager providing updates and checking referrals for relevant information, a Team Manager providing expert oversight and advice and the Chair being the YJS Service Manager/HOS. Police & Criminal Evidence* The local PACE protocol has recently been reviewed and updated by Nottinghamshire Police, the YJS and Children's Integrated Service (CIS) 
* A PACE request form has been developed and agreed between Nottinghamshire Police and CIS, this is to ensure that there is an audit trail of when requests are made for PACE beds and evidence of the response/actions following the request.
* A tracker is being kept of all cases/requests
* There is a joint monthly operational meeting between YJS Practice Specialist, CIS Duty team Service Manager and Nottinghamshire Police Inspector with responsibility for Custody Suites. This is held to review the management of PACE issues and audit any cases that were not managed according to the agreed process
* There are quarterly meetings meeting between HOS for Duty, HOS for Early Help and Nottinghamshire Police to review the PACE process and how it is being implemented by frontline staff.  Exclusions * The YJS HOS is involved in a partnership group, which has developed a pilot to avoid exclusions and has secured cooperation from a range of City schools - linked to both the knife carrying and SEND agendas.
* The YJS Management Board has the Nottingham City Council (NCC) Head of Access to Learning as a board member, which provides the opportunity to explore better information sharing and joint work between YJS and education in this arena.
* The YJS Operational manager is a member of the Fair Access Panel which ensures that the YJS has an input into the screening and decision making process Health Pathway * A clinical psychologist and speech and language therapist commissioned by NHSE Health and Justice CAMHS Transformation project, have recently joined the health team at the YJS. These two new roles will provide training and consultation to staff in order to meet the learning needs of young people and support the YJS in embedding trauma informed practice within our work
* CGL have now merged with Explore Families and have become CGL journey - putting the pieces together. In addition to their offer, they can now provide family and parental support, volunteers and mentors as well as continued work with young people on substance use and resilience.
* Two part-time physical health (school) nurses have also joined the YJS nursing team, on a twelve month secondmentDomestic Violence * The YJS continues to work alongside Equation, one of Nottingham's domestic abuse charities, which provides resources, training and best practice guidance for practitioners. Last year, Equation delivered best practice training for managing young perpetrators of domestic violence and abuse within teenage intimate relationships. We subsequently have two YJS Case Managers trained in delivering bespoke materials to young perpetrators, which they share/cascade with their colleagues to broaden the YJS skillset.
* YJS colleagues have all attended a range of courses delivered by Equation including Understanding and Responding to Domestic Violence (DV) and Abuse and understand how to identify, assess and refer DV and Abuse concerns. They are also able to access training events in assessing and supporting those experiencing domestic abuse.
* The YJS continues to contribute to two key partnership forums within Nottingham, the MARAC steering group, and the Children's  Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence Group, which plan the City's approach to managing DV, initiate new approaches, and address risks. Restorative Justice and Victims* A data-sharing agreement has now been finalised between the YJS Leadership Team and Victim Care, commissioned by OPCC as the main provider of victim support services in Nottingham. 
* We have developed practice guidelines to ensure a victim focus throughout the service.
* The RJ coordinator continues to deliver RJ training, including regular sessions of Community Resolution training to newly recruited PCs and PCSOs. Individual casework, conflict resolution within staff teams and restorative conferencing continues to be provided.
* A number of restorative conferences have been delivered and this has been expanded to cater for the OoCD triage system
* Victim Care staff assist with Victim awareness sessions at the JAC
* In June 2019 the Nottingham City Council's restorative justice quality mark was renewed by the RJ Council for 3 yearsYouth Conditional Cautions and First time entrants* Following on from YJS research on alternative approaches to managing FTEs and a commissioned report to the YJS Management Board in April 2018, a Triage system for FTEs has been in place since September 2018.
* Once the YJS Police Officer has completed the triage process, cases are referred to the OoCD panel, where a decision is made to consider a Community Resolution (CR), either Tier 1 or Tier 2 or a Youth Conditional Caution (YCC).  All those subject to a Tier 2 CR or a YCC are subject to an assessment that includes an assessment of risk and safety and wellbeing concerns.  Children given a YCC have a condensed Asset Plus completed.
* The OoCD Panel Terms of Reference have been updated by the Operational Manager and Restorative Justice Lead to reflect the changes in procedure from Nottinghamshire Police regarding dealing with weapon-enabled offending and to incorporate the Triage process
* Our YJS Police colleagues issue all OoCDs agreed at panel. Statutory Case Managers now manage all YCCs.  A dedicated PCSO and substance misuse partner support the delivery of YCC interventions and CRs. This means that the assessment and delivery of OoCD has been brought into line with the assessment and delivery of post-court interventions, to ensure that there is robust oversight of all young people with statutory disposals, including a comprehensive assessment and a proportionate intervention plan that meets the needs of the young person.Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements* To ensure practice consistency and keep YJS staff up to date with MAPPA guidance and policy, the MAPPA co-ordinator has recently delivered refresher briefings to YJS staff. 
* At the request of the MAPPA co-ordinator, the YJS manager with the lead for MAPPA contributes to multi-agency audits to quality assure MAPPA minutes.
* Continue to focus on Level 1 MAPPA 1 cases ensuring consistency and appropriate risk managementChild Sexual Exploitation* Nottingham Citycare Partnership (NCP) and Prostitute Outreach Worker (POW)  are providing support to review and develop the YJS Healthy Relationships programme for delivery in groups one to one and at the JAC  
* Work with NCP has provided a refreshed Healthy Relationship programme for boys, which now incorporates DV, CSE and grooming
* A POW worker will be delivering JAC/YJS group work sessions covering healthy relationships and CSE/grooming 
* A member of the YJS Leadership team attends monthly meetings identifying locations, venues and individuals that pose a risk to young people in regards to CSE. 
* The YJS continues to have representation strategically and operationally at the monthly Multi Agency Sexual Exploitation panel, CSE Cross Authority Group and the Concerns Network Meetings.  Junior Attendance Centre* A permanent Officer in Charge (OIC) was recruited in Oct 2017, having previously managed junior and adult Attendance Centres.  
* Since the recruitment of the permanent OIC, focus had been on recruitment of JAC staff. To date the OIC has successfully recruited eight paid staff, four volunteers and accessed support by three PCSOs. 
* Currently there is a concerted drive to increase the numbers of young people attending the JAC, by offering new programmes.
* The knife crime programme has been reviewed and has a three-tier approach of programmes for statutory orders. A separate knife crime programme for out of court disposal cases for the Case Manager to refer or work with a young person individually. 
* Other areas of the JAC/YJS intervention programmes are being reviewed, refreshed and supported by SEND trained colleagues. 
* The OIC is working with partners, specialist and service deliverers, including the Fire Service for Safer Driving, Nottingham Citycare Partnership on Healthy Relationships and Victim Care on Impacts on victims.
* Where suitable, AQA units are being completed as a way of acknowledging completion of work, i.e. Food Hygiene, Joint Enterprise, etc.
* Evaluation forms are in place as a way of collating and managing feedback from young people and facilitators to inform Case Managers and future service development.  Transitions* Within the last 6 months, the contribution by National Probation Service (NPS) to YJS has been reduced from 2 to 1.5 posts, which has affected case-holding capacity. 
* NPS secondees continue to hold relevant cases that meet NPS's E3 criteria, with predominant focus on case managing older, higher risk young people and those transitioning to NPS/Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRC).
* Before they transition, NPS secondees meet with relevant young people to prepare for the adjustment to adult supervision, with the additional aim of reducing risk of failed engagement and breach.
* NPS secondees complete risk assessments on those young people transitioning to determine eligibility for either adult offender organisation. All referrals, flowcharts and guidance have recently been refreshed by YJS to facilitate these processes. 
* NPS colleagues receive additional regular supervision from their NPS line manager, which maintains an effective link with their professional organisation and new developments.
* The NPS senior manager remains an integral partner of the YJS Board, and the CRC senior manager has recently joined the Board.  
* New CRC/YJS Transition Protocol includes a clear process of Transition and information exchange through a single CRC Transition SPOC
* Further funding from OPCC to work with non-statutory adults and YJS will liaise with police to support effective risk managementParticipation* The YJS is now fully embedded in its new, child-friendly premises at NGY. Young people and parents have responded positively to this environment, and behaviour on the premises has been mostly exemplary.
* We retain close links with the NCC's Engagement and Participation lead officer, and the YJS attend quarterly strategic meetings. Recent focus has included the NCC's plans for its new library and how best to engage a wide spectrum of views about the design to encourage maximum usage.
* The OIC at the Junior Attendance Centre gathers young people's views on a range of relevant topics, as required (e.g. knife carrying), and then shares these with Case Managers to inform case assessment and planning.
* We have completed research with a principal research fellow at Nottingham University who is developing a digital child-friendly device to enable young people to receive legal information about their rights. It involved consulting with some young people about their experiences of contact with the police as suspects.
* At the end of last year, young people played a significant role in the appointment of several YJS Targeted Youth Support colleagues. Opportunities to include young people in recruitment and selection processes will continue to be a focus.SEND* The YJS has been awarded a SEND quality mark in recognition of the work it has undertaken to improve its assessment and engagement with young people who have SEND issues.
* A Speech and Language therapist (SALT) has been recruited.
* The YJS has embedded a process that ensures that all young people are screened for SEND issues when they have contact with the YJS. 
* The screening process is supported by a scoring mechanism and referral route to consultation or direct work with the SALT if deemed to be necessary 
* Young people who display any concerns, but are only subject to CR (where an assessment is not completed) and dealt with by the Police, are also referred to the SALT. The SALT is then able to pass on any communication concerns to schools and other parties working with the young person. 
*  The SALT is currently reviewing all resources, letters and documentation to ensure that they are accessible to all young people. 
* The YJS has supported the Police to ensure communication leaflets for young people in the custody cells are SEND friendly. We have also supported the wider directorate to look at their paperwork that goes to young people.Partnerships and Funding opportunities We were successful in obtaining £490,000 funding through the MHCLG 'Supporting Families Against Youth Crime' bid to be spent against three key priorities, which strongly support YJS key outcomes.

* Strengthening the capacity of education providers to tackle SYV (for example by sharing/training current best practice)
* Developing a 'predictive model' and enhanced data sharing for this cohort
* Working with local trusted third sector providers to support them to deliver bespoke packages of support/programmes particularly to communities with whom statutory agencies have failed to engage

Our attendance at the Serious Violence Reference Group enabled us to bid for £15,000 YJB grant funding as part of our work to tackle SYV. This grant funding was used to commission 1 to 1 and group clinical supervision, provided by a chartered Counselling Psychologist, as part of the Icon programme.  
We have recently submitted a further bid of £45,000; if this bid is successful, we plan to embed further clinical supervision for YJS practitioners. 

In April 2018, the government published its Serious Violence Strategy. Part of that strategy was a commitment to provide £21 million over 2 years for a new early intervention youth fund, open to the OPCC as lead bidders, working with community safety partnerships. Although we were not successful when the initial bid awards were published in November 2018, in June 2019, Nottinghamshire was award £690,877. £305.000 of that bid has been awarded to Nottingham City YJS to deliver interventions, with the EVR Hub, Play and Youth service and community partners. Listed below is an indicative outline of how that grant fund will be utilised. 

* Personalised Budget Planning £30.000
* Transition into Employment £43.000
* Girls as Victims or Offenders £30.000
* EVR Hub £31.000
* Youth and Voluntary Engagement New and Emerging Communities - Voluntary sector £30.000
* Detached and Assertive Outreach - Voluntary Sector (for young people at risk) £48.000
* Detached and Assertive Outreach - Council (for young people at risk) £49.000
* Voluntary Sector - meeting the Demand £35.000
* Community Involvement in Developing Public Health Approach £8.000

Building on the success of the joint work with some of our trusted voluntary partners in 2018/19, the CCE panel has received funding from the OPCC that will allow the YJS to strengthen that partnership. The £96.000 grant funding will support the delivery of some personalised packages for young people, commissioned through those trusted voluntary partners. This arrangement enables the YJS to have access to community intelligence and brokerage that supports its aspirations to deliver interventions and diversionary activities close to the home and communities of YJS young people.  

In October 2018, the government announced plans for a £200m Youth Endowment Fund. The YEF has been launched to support the government's Serious Violence Strategy, by providing funding for early intervention. The YJS has collaborated with the Multi-Systemic Team (MST) National Implementation Service, who will be leading on a bid that includes the Nottingham YJS, Birmingham Children's Trust, Sandwell Children's Trusts and Kirklees Council, to develop a YJS specific MST team to work with young people at risk of SYV. Alongside this, Nottingham City Council has also submitted a bid to the YEF. Remands* Providing suitable alternatives to custodial outcomes is still a challenge, given some of the serious knife enabled offences that have been committed by young people in Nottingham over the past two years. 
* The YJS are working on various ventures for those young people that are persistent offenders and at risk of remand/custody, but do not pose an immediate risk to himself/herself or the community. 
* We are working to strengthen our ISS offer, with more funds being made available for Case Managers to provide more bespoke/tailored interventions for young people
* We are looking at developing training and employment opportunities such as the Skillmill and the Youth Employment Initiative (see the training and employment section below) which will enable ISS to be offered more regularly with a training option attached
* We are working with community partners to enable access to positive/diversionary activities
* The YJS Court staff continue to work closely with CIS to reduce the number of young people being remanded to the care of the Local Authority. It is expected practice that a social worker is present in court for any young people at risk of remand to Local Authority accommodation. Their task is to put forward an alternative support package for the young person that does not necessitate a remand to the care of the Local Authority.  . 
* YJS and CIS social workers work closely together to ensure any young people remanded to Youth Detention Accommodation are being visited according to National Standards and their status of a Looked After Child.Resettlement* As noted in previous years, the deletion of the resettlement grant has meant that resettlement continues to be a challenge for all YJS'. 
* The recent change to Futures involvement has also affected the management of resettlement for the YJS and young people.
* The Futures worker continues to check availability of relevant courses and employment opportunities
* Work continues to identify local partners that can offer support/mentoring for young people leaving custody.
* Case managers continue to ensure that SEND issues are being identified and addressed in the secure estate
* We have maintained a close working relationship with Wetherby YOI education department to ensure effective support for young people whilst in custodySerious Youth Violence 





The current offer by the YJS in partnership with its statutory  and voluntary partners to reduce serious youth violence: 

Child Criminal Exploitation

* The CCE panel is chaired monthly by the HOS for Early Help. The panel is comprised of key partners from Health, Education, Police, Social Care, Community Protection, Priority Families and the YJS. 
* The process is starting to evidence the progress from identification of concerns, through the completion of a 'toolkit' to assess CCE, to the outcomes of strategy meetings and other activity to respond to the risks and needs.
* A bespoke database supporting the CCE panel has been created to support information gathering, the tracking of actions and monitoring of CCE related activity. 
* The CCE panel process enables information sharing, a focused discussion and a quality assurance role, ensuring a contextualised safeguarding approach is taken to support the needs of children at risk of being exploited and to disrupt and identify barriers to the prosecution of alleged perpetrators.
* The CCE panel has secured funding from the OPCC to provide personalised commissioning from the voluntary sector to support engagement with the most challenging children. 

Vulnerabilities & Commodities (formerly known as SOC)

* The HoS feeds YJS data into tasking and uses intelligence information to direct resources
* The YJS trains and oversees deployment of PCSOs to prevent serious organised crime 
* The YJS is involved in joint strategic commissioning to tackle weapon-enabled offending 
* Support is provided to the voluntary sector in bid submissions and by offering training in safeguarding, restorative approaches etc.
* As part of a cohesive child-centred approach to tackling CCE and thereby preventing escalation into serious and organised crime  we have developed a response to addressing the significant increase nationally in the number of 'County Lines'.  Making use of national best practice as well as local partnerships, Nottingham YJS and Safeguarding managers have worked with partners from Community Protection and Police to set up a process to respond to those children at risk of exploitation.
* Crucial to service developments to tackle this emerging issue has been the acknowledgement that this is a safeguarding as well as public protection issue and that children's own victimisation and experience of trauma is a critical factor in them becoming entrenched in violent lifestyles.




Weapon enabled offending 

* 'Street Aware', is part of the 6-tier delivery plan offered to young people (year 6) in schools. Take up of this offer last year was 42 of the 75 City primary schools, a take up offer of 69% .This was updated ready for September 2018 and has improved on last year's figures with 55 out of 75 City primary schools a take up of 74%.
* All Nottingham City secondary schools will be offered the Street Aware presentations prior to the summer, through links with designated safeguarding leads.  There are two presentations - one for school years 7/8 and one for years 9/10. This was provided to a total of ten of the City secondary schools and four alternative provision by the end of the 2017/2018 school year. The early intervention police officers (in schools) will now facilitate these programmes.  
* The YJS has trained a range of community PCSOs in the Street Aware programme to ensure consistent messages are delivered to young people. This training was also provided to the police in school officers in September 2018 and twelve additional county PCSOs in March 2019.
* Those young people at risk of carrying weapons can be referred to the EVR Hub by our partners for consultation or for allocation to a TYSW to deliver individual one to one sessions.
* Young people referred through safeguarding as victims or perpetrators of weapon-enabled offending are allocated an appropriate preventative or statutory Youth Justice intervention
* Due to a number of incidents at one Nottingham academy, a TYSW previously dedicated one afternoon a week to work between both their sites. The work focused on knife crime, joint enterprise and healthy relationships. This is now done via the offer of the 6-week school's programme mentioned above.

The work being undertaken to address CCE, serious organised crime, weapon-enabled offending and the service being delivered by the EVR Hub, will also ensure NCC meets the Council pledge to Work with at least 500 young people each year at risk of becoming involved in gangs and knife crime or at risk of exploitationExploitation and Violence Reduction Hub



EVR HUB 

* Recently, the EVR Hub was officially launched at National Justice Museum. 
* The EVR Hub has developed incrementally since October 2018 and continues to evolve as we establish additional funding and partnership engagement 
* The majority of the YJS prevention programme is delivered through the EVR Hub. The EVR Hub provides intervention/consultation to children and young people within the City boundaries identified as at risk of criminal exploitation or youth violence.
* Consultation is provided to open CIS cases where there is an allocated worker that can undertake direct work with the young person. Consultation provides information about resources that can be used and available diversion activities across the City.
* A six-week programme created and delivered by TYSW aimed at preventing exclusion has been delivered in various schools/academies, including Emmanuel, Farnborough, Nottingham Academy, Bluecoat, Ellis Guilford and Bulwell Academy. It has also been delivered at the following Alternative Provisions, Aspire (Bluecoat Provision), Fuel, Stone Soup and Denewood/Unity.
* There are ongoing discussions to enable access to all secondary schools/academies and alternative provisions within the City  
* Bespoke whole day school year interventions have also been provided to year nine students in various schools. These have focused on the consequences of offending, grooming and young people being at risk. 
* The TYSW provide one to one casework on a weekly basis, with a view to signposting to positive diversionary activities. This is also offered to victims of knife crime.
* The EVR Hub staff have developed a catalogue of activities to be delivered over the coming months, to young people struggling with education, on a reduced timetable and at risk of reoffending. Predominantly developed as group work activities, but can be delivered to individuals who would benefit from specific targeted intervention/activities. Currently this is aimed at the Bulwell and Clifton area, but will be rolled out across the City if reviews are favourable. 
* All referrals that would previously have been channelled through the Young People's Panel are now referred directly to the Hub if they are not open to other partners, or through NCC Duty team/front door if there is a risk due to safety and well-being concerns. 
* The CIS duty team forwards all PPNs to the Hub team regarding young people involved in CCE or weapon-enabled offending. This enables the TYSW to contact the young people and offer support when necessary. Trauma Informed Practice * Over the past 5 years, CIS has been developing a strong, evidence-based practice model, supported by recognised principles and methods of working, to understand and respond to the trauma experienced by our most vulnerable and challenging children and families. This approach clearly reinforces the victim-based focus of the YJS, given the undeniable link between victimisation and later life offending.
* It is increasingly recognised that Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have a significant impact on the factors linked to offending. Many of our children, young people and families will have experienced traumatic events, which can shape how they behave and relate to professionals and services. 
* Trauma-informed practice gives us a framework to understand this process and how to shape our interventions better to meet the needs of traumatised children, young people and families.
* In the summer of 2018, within the YJS we piloted a two-day training package on trauma-informed practice, for frontline practitioners, managers and specialists. This included the principles, signs and symptoms of trauma, the impact of trauma, acknowledging existing models of practice and improving ways of working with traumatised children and families.  
* This was further consolidated with a leadership session to embed the principles within practice. This involved embedding specific questions about vicarious trauma within line management supervision and trauma within case supervision.
* Drawing on the preliminary findings of the pilot, the YJS was successful in obtaining a YJB grant for reducing SYV, which was used to support this project and commission 1:1 and group clinical supervision, provided by a chartered Counselling Psychologist, as part of the Icon programme.  
This gave all staff the opportunity to: explore the emotional impact working with complex children has on the individual; to develop formulation skills to help better understand the underlying causes of behaviour; to think about how interventions can be undertaken in a more trauma-informed way. 
* The YJS Clinical Psychologist is helping to embed trauma informed practice and creating a framework for consultation and service delivery. 
* The YJS Clinical Psychologist has delivered further training to increase practitioner awareness and ensure the service is trauma informed.  Training and Employment 

Skillmill 

* Currently work is ongoing to launch the Skillmill
* The Skillmill is a social enterprise originally set up by Newcastle YOS in September 2013, funded through the Life Chances Fund (a Social Impact Bond). The Skillmill delivers a six-month programme of intensive training and employment through the provision of supervised environmental maintenance jobs. While on placement the participants will be paid, at the end of this period, they will receive an accreditation of their training at National Vocational Qualification Level II.
* The aim of the Skillmill is to reduce re-offending and secure employment or further training for participants. Evaluation of previous Skillmill's indicates that only 6% of participants re-offend within one year compared with 40% of all young offenders. The cohort of participants must be 16-18 year olds who are in the top 10% of offenders and are at high risk of re-offending.  
* Nottingham YJS is one of five YJSs who were included in a bid for £2M of Big Lottery's Life Chances Fund to set up a Skillmill. This will take the total to ten Skillmill's across the country. The current aim is two cohorts per year of four individuals, over a 4-year period, supervised by a programme supervisor seconded from the local authority to the Skillmill. 
* Work is ongoing to bring local and national partners on Board to support the programme

          Nottingham work project - Youth Employment Initiative (inc Youcan Project) 

* The Nottingham Works Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) programme is a 5-year strategy, supported by NCC and the European Social Fund (ESF).  The ESF will commit to a contribution to salary costs of those staff involved on the project, which will be directly reimbursed to the YJS.  In order to achieve this funding, each year a pre-determined number of participants must:

1. Complete the programme (comprised of 5 activities)
2. Receive an offer of education, employment or training upon leaving
3. Move into education, employment or training or gain a qualification upon leaving

* The YJS has agreed to provide 3 posts to this initiative; 1 Hub worker and 2 Case managers. The Hub worker is taking the lead on the delivery of the YouCan programme (which forms part of programme activity 4), and 2 Case managers (one representative from each locality) will lead on the delivery of the 5 programme activities across the service. 
* The programme activities include assessment and planning of young people's needs; direct support and intervention in addressing factors affecting desistance relating to learning, education, training and employment; CV writing; and application and enrolment for accredited education, training or employment opportunities.
* In order to extend the scope of this programme, where possible the YEI programme will be integrated into normal YJS practice, with existing assessments, plans and record keeping forming the basis of the work undertaken with those children who are eligible (must be NEET, permanent residents in the City of Nottingham, and aged 15 to 29).Children in Care* Partners in Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire sign the multi-agency Reducing Offending Behaviour protocol for children in care (CiC) in Nottingham City. The protocol is starting to achieve its aim to reduce the criminalisation of CiC, and to embed restorative justice and early intervention. 
* We propose that the publication of the 'National Protocol on reducing the unnecessary criminalisation of looked after children and care leavers' (DfE 2018) published in November 2018, should prompt a multi-agency review of the current Protocol. 
* The Arrest Screening Programme for CiC is incorporated in YJS systems. The YJS puts the Officer in Charge in contact with the team around the child, to consider opportunities for diversion where possible. Where prosecution is appropriate, the Crown Prosecution Service's 10-point checklist is embedded in court practice. All these processes are helping to reduce the criminalisation of CIC in Nottingham. 
* Practitioner Forums are taking place a  minimum of 3 times per year for local authority and private residential care, semi-independent providers and foster carers for 10 years plus. The CIC Police and YJS Leads chair these. They provide an arena to enable multi-agency working, share best practice, promote reflection and to offer advice or guidance. 
* As a directorate we continue to listen to the voice of CiC and Care Leavers by attending nominated CiC Council/Your Voice meetings where invited, or where changes to policy in this area are considered.) 
* The YJS RJ coordinator continues to provide consultation and direct work with young people and carers to resolve conflict informally.
