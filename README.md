# Text Mining in R Training - Session #1

This repo containes the information, code & corpus for a first session in Text Mining [TM] using the R package tidytext.

* The code for the course is based around the book '_Text Mining in R_' by Julia Silge and David Robinson.
* The session covers a TM workflow process & a qualitative methodology which does not largely appear in Silge and Robinson's book.
* The repo also includes specific MoJ/DASD relevant text corpuses to make use of during the session.

**The TM sessions are still in development & this repo & Read Me will continue to developed further with the delivery of nore TM sessions.**
