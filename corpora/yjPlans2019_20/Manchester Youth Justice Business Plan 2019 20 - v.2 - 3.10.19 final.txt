Business Plan 2019/20 

Forward by the Chair of the Management Board 
 
This plan gives an overview of the work of the Youth Justice Service in Manchester, setting out details of performance over the past twelve months, the priorities we set for ourselves and the priorities for the coming year. The Youth Justice Plan together with other key local partnership strategies aspires to ensure that 'Our children will be inspired to confidently live healthy, safe, successful and crime-free lives' as we are working together to make Manchester a place where children of all backgrounds can feel safe, can aspire, succeed and live well.  
 
This year has been a busy one for the Youth Justice Service with the development of a new model of working with those children referred in by the police for an out of court assessment, the implementation of the Service Development Plan to improve the case-management system, recording and data accuracy and inspection preparations were underway when the HMI Full Joint Inspection was announced.  The inspectors in their findings highlighted the positive work of case-managers and endorsed management and leadership within the service and the management board.  They also raised concerns about safety and security of Youth Justice Offices given the increased incidents of youth violence within the city and work was already underway in recognition of this.  The recommendations of the inspection inform the new Business Plan as do the outcomes of the recent review of the Youth Justice Service which was undertaken in full consultation with all who work in it, partners and the young people who have given their views on how service delivery can be improved. 
 
The Service and those who work in it continue to receive praise and recognition for their excellent work and this year has been no exception. The Achievement for All award for the Quality Leadership was presented to the Head of Service at the YJB Convention in recognition of the development of skills and knowledge within the Service on Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND). Butler Trust awards were given to two team managers for their work on SEND and Child Criminal Exploitation and this was an exceptional honour for the service.  There were also nominations for the Corporate Awards of Excellence and 6 young people achieved Bronze Arts awards for their good work on the 'Rock Up' music project. 
 
The next twelve months promises to be busy but productive for the Youth Justice Service as the actions and priorities identified are turned into reality with support from other services and partners. All of this will be driven by the commitment of the wider partnership to work to support our local communities to build a safe, happy, healthy and successful future for all children and young people. 
 
On behalf of the Management Board, I am pleased to present the Youth Justice Business Plan 2019/20. 
 

 
Paul Marshall 
Strategic Director of Children and Education Services  
Chair of the Youth Justice Management Board 
Welcome to the 19/20 YJ Business Plan 
 
Introduction 
Welcome to the 2019/20 Youth Justice Business Plan which sets out details about the Service, its performance and strategic priorities for the next 12 months.  In line, with the 'Our Manchester Strategy', the vision for those in the Youth Justice System is that 'Our Children will be inspired to confidently live healthy, safe, successful and crimefree lives'. There is a strategic overlap with the Manchester Children and Young People's Plan 'Our Manchester, Our Children' which is working to 'Building a safe, happy, healthy and successful future for children and young people'. This annual plan was presented to and approved by the Manchester Youth Justice Management Board on 8 August 2019. 
 
Manchester Youth Justice Service is a statutory multi-agency partnership between the police, children's services, health, probation, community safety and other partners established under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 with the principal aim of preventing offending by children and young people. Local Authorities are responsible for establishing a Youth Justice Service within their area.  Police, National Probation Service and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are statutorily required to assist in their funding and operation. In Manchester, the Service is engaged with a wide range of partners and providers as well as working collaboratively with other Youth Justice Services, academics and the Mayor's Office to strengthen performance and quality of work as well as improving outcomes for children and young people. 
 
Review of 2018/19 
The HMIP Full Joint Inspection of the service in October 2018 was an      opportunity to learn from the impressions made and the advice given by a range of inspectors including those from CQC, OFSTED, Work and Skills, HMI of Constabulary as well as HMI Probation. 
 
Inspectors identified strengths in the service including the management and leadership and the strong partnership that supports the work of the service. The report described the workforce as committed, acknowledged the good assessment and planning for those children on orders and recognised that the range of resources and specialist workers available to respond to the needs of children and young people. The work on disproportionality was praised as was the good recognition of diversity factors in the lives of young people. The development of a new Out of Court Disposal Panel was acknowledged and work underway was described as 'promising'. 
 
Inspectors were critical of premises in North of the City following incidents of violence between young people coming to and from appointments. They described the location as unsuitable and recommended that new office accommodation be found quickly.  Delays in recruitment that had caused caseloads to be high at the time of the inspection were identified as a weakness as was the high numbers of children and young people not accessing full-time school, training or employment. 
 
The overall rating outcome was 'Requires Improvement' and the subsequent report was published in February 2019 by which time, implementation of an action plan was well underway. The recommendations and actions will form a key part of the 2019/20 business planning. 
Performance targets: 
Ambitious targets were agreed for the service in 18/19 building on the successes we achieved the previous year, particularly for reductions in First Time Entrants and Reoffending.  We recognised that reducing the use of custody is the biggest challenge and set what we considered to be a realistic target.  
 
Each of the three performance measurements are explored in detail, but the below highlights our general performance against the targets set in the 2018/19 Business Plan: 
 
Performance data First Time Entrants Custody Reoffending Number recorded in Quarter 1: 55 10 N/A Number recorded in Quarter 2: 51 14 N/A Number recorded in Quarter 3: 42 16 N/A Number recorded in Quarter 4: N/A 11 N/A Final rate: 418 1.09 31.6% Target rate: 399 0.9 36% Achieved target:        
Source: 98 YDS for England and Wale Apr 18 - Mar 19 
 
? FTE: the FTE figure available from the YDS on which our target is based, is for the calendar year 2018. Our final rate for 2018 was 418, as there were a total of 191 FTE.  
 
? Reoffending: The YDS uses a cohort from 2016, so data is historic. The final achieved rate is based on the latest YDS, which has a rate of 31.6% for a cohort taken from April-June 2017.  
 
? Custody: our final custody is 1.09 following 53 custodial sentences in 2018/19.  
  
All rates are based on Manchester mid-year population of 46,667, as provided by the YDS. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First time entrants (FTE): Manchester's FTE has reduced significantly over the past five years, but remains higher than all comparison areas: 

 
Source: 98 YDS for England and Wale Apr 18 - Mar 19 
 
Offence quantity for FTE ranged from 1 to 24, with an average of 2.6 offences per FTE. Violence against the person was the most common offence: 
 
All offences linked to FTE Number All offences linked to FTE Number Arson 1 Non Domestic Burglary 9 Breach Of Bail 11 Other 4 Breach Of Conditional Discharge 1 Public Order 35 Breach Of Statutory Order 14 Racially Aggravated 10 Criminal Damage 28 Robbery 63 Domestic Burglary 6 Sexual Offences 17 Drugs 27 Theft And Handling Stolen Goods 38 Fraud And Forgery 4 Vehicle Theft / Unauthorised Taking 18 Motoring Offences 66 Violence Against The Person 116  
ChildView FTE report for 2018 - report date 12/6/19 
 
The YJB uses PNC data to calculate FTE rates, consequently, it is not possible to directly match our internal case management data with the FTE figures. However, our internal data can provide insight into the majority of those who became FTE in 2018, including the type of outcomes received: 
 
Substantive Outcome Type Number % Community Penalty 12 7% Youth Rehabilitation Order  12 7% Custodial sentence 10 5% Detention + Training Order (Custody) 6 3% Section 91 Order 3 2% First-tier penalty 90 49% Conditional Discharge 4 2% Fine 9 5% Referral Order 76 42% Youth Caution + Conditions 1 1% OOCD 70 38% Youth Caution 60 33% Youth Caution + Conditions 5 3% Youth Conditional Caution 5 3%  
ChildView FTE report for 2018 - report date 12/6/19 
 
Referral Orders were the most common outcome type for FTE recorded on ChildView, followed by Youth Cautions. 
 
Key demographic features of the FTE cohort were: 
 
? Age range 11 to 18 | Average age 15 | 52% aged 16 and over 
? 13% female | 77% male 
? Ethnicity 5+1 breakdown: 8% Asian | 19% Black | 10% Mixed ethnic | 13% Other/unknown | 49% White 
 
Custody: There were 51 custodial sentences in Manchester in 2018/19, this equates to a rate of 1.09 per 1,000 of the young people population of Manchester. 
 
The use of custody has risen by 6% since last year, and Q3 2018/19 saw the highest recorded number of custodial sentences during the previous two year period:

Manchester's custodial rate continues to be higher than all comparator areas: 

 
Source: 98 YDS for England and Wale Apr 18 - Mar 19 
The majority of those sentenced to custody in 2018/19 were male (96%), White (59%), and were aged 17 on average. In terms of ethnicity, Black children continued to be overrepresented but the extent of this has reduced markedly: 

ChildView custody report - date 4/6/19 
 
Additional features of those sentenced to custody in 2018/19 were: 
 
? 29% of the cohort had been LAC at some point prior to being sentenced (excluding those who became LAC due to a remand only) 
? 39% of the cohort were sentenced for offences involving the use or possession of a weapon 
? 31% of the cohort were sentenced for offences involving the breach of an existing order 
? 22% of the cohort were first time entrants (FTE). There were 11 young people in total who were FTE when sentenced to custody, the types of offences they were sentenced for were: 
? 6 involved robbery 
? 4 involved serious  (gravity 7-8) violence 
? 1 involved gravity 8 sexual offence 
? 1 was gravity 4 but involved a firearm and bail breach 
? 25% of the cohort had previously served a custodial sentence 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reoffending: Reoffending is measured by the YJB for a cohort of children who were open to YJ Service approximately 2 years earlier. The timeframe for measuring reoffending by the YJB has been visualised below: 
 
 

 
Due to the way the YJB calculate reoffending, it is not possible to give a final reoffending figure for the whole of 2018/19. However, we can present the latest YDS figures for Manchester and comparator areas that highlight Manchester's continued positive performance. 
 
Our binary reoffending rate has reduced to 31.6%, the lowest recorded rate to date. This rate is lower than all comparison areas, including the current National rate of 38.4%. 
 
Our frequency reoffending rate has risen to 5.58 which is higher than all comparison areas. This fits an ongoing pattern with Manchester reoffending, whereby, there are less children reoffending, but those that do commit a high number of offences.

In addition to the official YDS data, we have begun to utilise the YJB live tracker to analyse the reoffending activity of more recent cohorts. To date we have ran the live tracker for Quarters 3 and 4 2017/18, and the results have been reassuring but this needs to be tested out for longer so that we have a greater understanding of how we can be confident of the accuracy of the information. 
 
 
 
 
 
Looked After Children, known as 'Our Children': The number of Our Children open to Youth Justice, excluding those who became LAC due to a remand only, has decreased during the past two years, as per the below table: 
 
Children open to YJ 2017/18 2018/19 All 338 308 Our Children 56 17% 41 13% Our Children (due to remand only)  23 7% 35 11% Our Children combined total 79 23% 76 25%  
The Service has experienced an increase in the use of remand over the last year, and this is directly evident in the increase in the combined LAC figure. 
 
Remands: There were 54 new remands started in 2018/19, with 13 remands, on average, active each month:

Out of Court Disposals (OOCDS): The Greater Manchester OOCD Pilot began in June 2018, and saw the creation of Youth Panel's designed to determine the outcome for children who would have traditionally received an OOCD directly from Greater Manchester Police (GMP). Between 1st June 2018 and 31st May 2019, there have been 237 cases referred to the OOCD process. 50% of all cases that have completed the process to date have received a non-substantive outcome (CR, RJ or NFA). This equates to 104 children who may have traditionally received an immediate substantive outcome and formally entered the criminal justice system. 
 
In the first year of the OOCD pilot in Manchester, our engagement rate (for all cases where a disposal was offered) has more than doubled to 54% (compared to 24% under the old process). This figure improves further (to 79%) when we break cases down into those where the OOCD was referred to Manchester YJ without an OOCD being pre-administered. 
 
 
Education Data: Breakdown of the education, training and employment (ETE) status of all children known to the Youth Justice Service over the past two years reveals that although NEET rate remains high, the robustness of our ETE recording has increased significantly:

Other priorities identified for this period included: 
Priority 18/19 Update 19/20 Join the Greater Manchester Youth Justice and GMP pilot and form a 
Youth Panel to manage the Triage Process of all children referred in for an out of court assessment Completed.  The pilot has been in place for over 12 months and early results show some significant gains including levels of engagement doubling.  Strengthen the quality of all casework by learning from previous Ofsted and HMI Probation themed inspections and bringing in more independent scrutiny to support internal quality assurance work Completed. The service learns from all Ofsted and HMIP inspection findings and has undergone a HMIP Full Joint Inspection during the year. In addition, we have been subject to a Greater Manchester Youth Justice Peer Review. The Head of Service is an LGA Peer Reviewer and has recently undertaken a review of Hackney Youth Justice Service. Continue to improve joint working between 	Youth 	Justice 	CaseManagers and Social Workers on those young people who are Looked 
After, on Child Protection or Child in 
Need Measures 
 Ongoing. There are two recently appointed Youth Justice Social Workers in the Service. As a result, there is ongoing work with the new Care Leavers Service and an agreed protocol between services is now in place. Numbers of those on Care Orders coming into the service has fallen and there are fewer children being prosecuted 
for offences taking place in Children's Homes.  Build on the strong partnership with MMU to develop a Participation Strategy for the Service which is in line and supports the wider 'Our Manchester' strategy 
 Completed. Together with MMU, we have developed the 8 agreed principles of the Engagement Framework which going forward, will underpin our work with children and young people in Manchester 
 Prepare for inspection under the new HMI Probation Inspection Framework and using these standards to selfassess and identify gaps which will form the basis of a service-wide action plan. Learn from recent inspection reports, particularly the themed ones on Public Protection, Out of Court Disposals and Referral Orders Completed.  Establish a Working Party to review the work of the service on Referral Orders, plan the re-training of relevant workers and volunteers and refresh the delivery whilst evaluating the impact on children, families and victims Completed. New 'Making It Right' model is in place. Evaluation will be undertaken by MMU. Set up a Skill Mill, an employment project for young people, with support from Newcastle Youth Justice 
Service following the successful bid to the Life Chances Fund 
 Postponed. Delays in Government funding agreements has slowed down implementation nationally. Work with Education and Health partners to achieve a Quality Mark for the work of the Service on Special 
Education Needs and Disability 
 Completed. Quality Leadership Award received in November 2018. Continue to support and develop research into the effectiveness of the work of the Service using the good partnership with academics and universities including MMU, The University of Manchester and the New York State Universities supporting the Realist Evaluation approach 
 Ongoing. The Youth Justice Service has continued to use research to improve effectiveness. This has included; updating realist evaluation data; investigating the impact of substance misuse support services; levels of disproportionality and MMU undergraduate dissertation work. 
 Strengthen 	the 	collaboration between GM Youth Justice Services and 	the 	Greater 	Manchester 
Combined Authority to deliver our joint strategic objectives 
 Completed. Achieved: 
? GM Strategic plan objectives 
? Established New GM Youth Justice Transformation Board 
? Justice and Rehabilitation Board now focused on Youth Justice priorities 
? Members of GM Health and Justice Board with new strategy bring more focus and resources into Youth 
Justice  
Service Recognition and Awards:  
In addition, the Service and individuals who work within it have been recognised for their achievements. One of our Case-managers, Gemma Smith, was nominated and selected as the Directorate nominee for the category of 'Rising Star' in the Corporate Awards for Excellence. This award is for those who have impressed their colleagues and managers with high levels of motivation and performance.  
 
Two Youth Justice Team Managers were nominated and went on to receive Butler Trust Awards. Dawn Johnson was awarded a Butler Trust certificate by Sir Michael Harrison, chair of the Awarding Panel, for her work on Child Criminal Exploitation in Manchester. Vanessa O'Dare went to St James's Palace to receive her award from Princess Anne, which was given for her development work on the service's approach to children with Special Education Needs and Disability.   
 
The service was presented with the 'Achievement for All' Quality Leadership Award at the annual Youth Justice Convention in recognition of the standard of the work in improving our impact. 
 
For many of those young people known to the service, the opportunity to win awards have been few. This year, six of them undertook an Arts programme called 'Rock Up' which was facilitated jointly with TIPP (a drama and arts voluntary sector organisation).  It was a 5 day music based project during which young people had the opportunity to learn to play instruments and as a group write, perform and record their own music; with a music track produced at the end.   All six young people attended the sessions and produced excellent work to achieve their Bronze Art Award.   
 
Going Forward: 
Good progress has been achieved on the priorities set for 2018/19.  Going forward, the drivers for shaping the 2019/20 key priorities will build on achievements to date and include the recent service wide review, the inspection recommendations and the workforce's commitment to improve the outcomes for all our young people. 
 
Review of the Youth Justice Service: 
A full review of the Youth Justice Service was initiated in early 2019 and has been an opportunity for the service to reflect on levels of participation that we want to build upon, the aspirations we have for our young people, and the further development of outcome-driven practice.   This was a good opportunity to consider how the service can develop and deliver its priorities as well as respond to the key issues and trends locally. It builds on the learning from the Charlie Taylor review, the HMIP inspection findings and recommendations and will support the service to deliver an aspirational offer as part of our prevention, diversion and desistance work.  This project was carried out in close consultation with the Youth Justice workforce who attended full staff events to allow us all to share our views and ideas on how to improve the outcomes of the services provided.  There have been consultations with a wide group including case-managers, secondees and specialists who work within the service as well as children and young people. The Youth Justice Management Board (which has both statutory and non-statutory partner representation) contributed to the consultation too.  
 
The full service events were used to share reflections on the review that have been gathered and highlight the agreed principles and priorities that drive the work of all of those in the Youth Justice system. A key principle is building trusted relationships with young people as we know from a previous 'Realist Evaluation' study by Dr Mansoor Kazi, that when a young person is engaged and successfully completes an order from the court, they are 7 times less likely that those who don't, to re-offend. The Service's Re-offending rate has reduced to its lowest ever rate at 31.6% (and out-performs all comparison areas) so the focus is on building on our assets, strengthening engagement to address needs and risks.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Priorities for 2019/20: 
There were 5 recommendations identified within the HMIP Inspection Report published in February 2019 which are now priorities for the service.  
 
Ensure premises are safe and accessible for children and young people, as well as staff.  In line with the inspectors' recommendations, the teams that were 1. 
based in the North of the city are currently located in temporary offices.  New office space for the ISS Team has now been found and requires some adaptations and refurbishment which is underway.  This is a good development and will enable the team to deliver a revised programme in a city centre location thus promoting the independence of the young people. The search is still underway for the right accommodation for the North Locality team and this is a priority for the Service going forward. 
 
Ensure that there are sufficient staff in post to deliver high-quality services to children and young people.  At the time of the inspection there were 7 2. 
vacancies all of which had been appointed to but post holders had not started. Currently, there are four vacancies, two of which have been filled but the postholders not yet started. The impact of this improved speed of recruitment is that caseloads within the service have reduced to a more desirable level. We recognise that whilst turnover is low in the service we are now able to respond flexibly and quickly to fill vacancies.  
 
Ensure that children and young people receive effective support to improve their chances of success in education, training and employment, and increase the proportion who receive their full entitlement. Achieving good 3. 
impact from this action has required a complete review of how the Service engages with education, schools, colleges and employers to improve outcomes for young people on the Youth Justice caseload.  A more detailed action plan has been drawn up between the Service, Education and Work and Skills Managers to bring expertise into Youth Justice including learning from the Virtual School's Personal Education Planning (PEP) approach and establishing Career Connect worker, colocated within the service who is available to advise young people and link them with opportunities. Youth Justice Workers are committed to working with schools and colleges to get better outcomes for young people and have many good ideas to take forward to achieve this and are keen to establish better links with schools to encourage and support teachers to keep children engaged in full-time education.  
Continue to develop out-of-court decision-making processes to make sure that effective joint decision-making is in place, and that children and young people and their parents/carers understand the implications of the disposal.    4. 
 
The triage model of working with GMP to assess those young people referred by the police, and through the use of a multi-agency panel to make recommendations for a suitable disposal, was introduced in June 2018 and inspectors expressed confidence in the approach. The model has since been strengthened by the introduction of a shorter assessment tool (which has been developed with Manchester Metropolitan University - MMU) and has been rolled out across all Greater Manchester Services as agreed with GMP.  A leaflet has been designed by young people to inform others (and their parents) what it means to get an Out of Court Disposal. Engagement levels of young people vary in Out of Court work as most outcomes rely upon a young person's voluntary agreement to an intervention. An analysis of the first 12 months of the new approach shows that levels of engagement have doubled in that period. 
 
Work with partner agencies to reduce the over-representation of black and minority ethnic children and young people in the custodial population. The 5. 
work on levels of disproportionality has continued to follow the national picture.  This is an area the service keeps under review whilst implementing the recommendations in the David Lammy report which highlights the disproportionate levels of BAME children and adults in the criminal justice system. A key element of our plan going forward is to raise the profile of BAME disproportionality identified within the Youth Justice Service locally and across Greater Manchester.   We will work with academics and researchers within Manchester Metropolitan University to develop a better understanding of the problem and share the findings widely. In seeking to address the issue, we will work with Greater Manchester Police, the Greater Manchester Deputy Mayor's office and sentencers.  'Unconscious Bias' training is planned for all who work within the Youth Justice Service and we will encourage other services to do the same. 
 
To measure the level of improvement within the Youth Justice Service, a Youth Justice Peer Review will take place in early 2020. 
 
Other Priorities: 
The numbers of children and young people being remanded into custody by the courts in Manchester is too high.  A priority therefore is for the service will develop a strategy to address this and find better ways and different approaches to avoid the number and length of children subject to remand orders in the city.  
 
In addition, this year we want the Participatory Youth Practice Engagement Framework to underpin case managers and managers approach to designing and delivering interventions. The 8 key principles forms an approach  where children and their families are involved in the decision making enabling interventions to be done with them and not just to them (for example, the new Referral Order Making it right Panel).  We have travelled from a service that was prescriptive ("this is what you are doing"), to engaging children in consultation ("this is what we are going to do, is this ok?") and are now in a position where we are enabling and children and their families to truly participate ("What should we be doing? Let's decide together"). We will undertake workshops with staff and continue to work with MMU to embed this framework into our practice. 
 
Good management oversight is key to improving practice and delivering good outcomes. We are committed to strengthening our quality assurance approach and implementing our Audit Plan (see Appendix 6). 
 
We are committed to developing our workforce generally and specifically within our partnership, focussing on our responses to children who are at risk of becoming to avoid their involvement or have been perpetrators and/or victims of Serious Youth Violence including knife crime. Levels of trauma experienced by children are more evident than before and so our practice needs to be trauma-informed. Adverse 
Childhood Experience training has enhanced case-managers' understanding of a child's life experiences and limited life chances, meaning that our assessments and interventions are less prescriptive and completely individualised. Using a strength based approach to our assessments and plans increases the opportunities for children to be inspired to achieve better outcomes.  We will continue to capture the children's views of the service and ideas on how to improve the design and delivery of our assessments and interventions. We will provide good support including clinical supervision for case-managers and managers will strengthen our focus on the health and well-being of all those who work in the service. 
 
2019/20 Performance Targets: Our three key performance targets for 2018/19 are presented below, alongside are previous performance: 
 

 
Additional performance targets set for 2019/20 are:

Structure and Governance: 
Responsibility for governance arrangements for the Youth Justice Service sits within the multi-agency Manchester Youth Justice Management Board.  The Chair of this Board is the Director of Children's Services and the Deputy Chair is the Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the National Probation Service (NPS). The Manchester Youth Justice Management Board is comprised of key partners including senior managers from within the Local Authority, senior representatives from statutory partner agencies, Police, Health, Probation, the voluntary sector and other criminal justice representatives. The Head of Youth Justice reports to the Strategic Head of Early Help who is a Board member. The Terms of Reference have been recently reviewed and can be found in Appendix 3.  
 
The Management Board ensures that the Service can deliver effectively and improve outcomes for young people in a number of ways: 
 
? Scrutinising performance and giving strategic direction and support to improve outcomes for children, young people and victims 
? Providing good oversight of budget management and ensure the service is adequately resourced and provides value for money 
? Overseeing the development and implementation of the Youth Justice business planning process 
? Linking the strategic priorities of the Youth Justice Service with other strategies and plans to ensure that effective planning and maximum impact can be achieved  
? All partners have a good understanding and take appropriate ownership of the barriers to the delivery of improved outcomes for children and young people ? Reviewing statutory partners' contributions to the running of an effective Youth Justice Service 
 
Manchester Youth Justice Service is fully integrated into other strategic planning bodies for children and young people as well as criminal justice services. The Head of Service is a member of the Children's Safeguarding Board, the Serious Case Review Sub-group, the Community Safety Board and the Prevent Steering Group.   
 
There is good collaborative working between the Youth Justice Services in the 10 Local Authorities that make up the Greater Manchester. There are examples of joint commissioning, joint training and quality assurance as well as initiatives such as the Greater Manchester Youth |Justice and University Partnership. The Head of Manchester chairs the monthly forum for Youth Justice Strategic Leads and the interests of Greater Manchester Youth Justice Services are well represented on the Local Criminal Justice Board, the Health and Justice Board and the Greater Manchester Children's Safeguarding Board.  There is considerable collaboration and joint working with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and the Greater Manchester Mayor's Office to improve the impact and outcomes of Youth Justice Services.  
 
Resource and Value for Money: 
The review of Manchester Youth Justice Service to explore models of service delivery has been carried out within the context of reducing budgets whilst maintaining an effective response to the needs and risks presented by young people and delivering good value for money.  
 
Like all public services the YJS faces many financial challenges. We recognise the significant responsibility placed on us to continue to deliver positive outcomes whilst also striving to make efficiencies.  
 
Improving prevention, early intervention and diversion activities as well as collaboration and innovation with other services in Manchester and Greater Manchester is the most likely route to achieving these. The joint work with the Deputy Mayor's office has led to additional resources coming into the service specifically for the development of Out of Court responses and this work has been supported well by the partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University.  More recent engagement with the Health and Justice Board has led to additional Speech and Language Therapy within the Service as well as the piloting of a neuro-disability screening tool, the Do-it-Profiler. So the focus is on influencing other services, particularly universal ones, to improve prevention and early intervention so that the numbers of First Time Entrants reduces further whilst improving access to a wider range of support and services for those that do enter the system so that reducing re-offending rates continues to fall and fewer children go into custody.

Commissioned Services: 
In addition to the secondments from Health, Probation and Police, and in order to provide a range of effective interventions, the Youth Justice Service commissions services from different organisations including: 
 
? Remedi 
? Child Action North West 
? The Growth Company 
? CANW 
? Salford Health Foundation Trust 
? One Education 
? Young Fathers 
 
Partnership Arrangements: 
Integrated partnership arrangements drive effective working in Manchester Youth Justice and help deliver good outcomes for our children and young people. The Our Manchester Strategy together with the Manchester Children's Plan sets out our aspirations for the city as we want it to be a place where children of all backgrounds feel safe, can aspire, succeed and live well. We are working with our partners and local communities to build a safe, happy, healthy and successful future for all children and young people. 
 
Manchester Youth Justice Service workforce models effective partnership working with secondees from police, probation and health forming part of the teams working together with other commissioned services including workers from Remedi, a restorative justice charity, the Growth Company, a local not-for-profit training and employment organisation, Drama Therapists from One Education and a Speech Therapist.  Other services are provided by partners including substance misuse support, education psychologists and Manchester Metropolitan University who provide training and research opportunities.  
 
The two social worker posts within the Youth Justice Service have helped to develop a more integrated approach to the supervision of children who are on the current caseload of Social Care. One post holder is focused on ensuring all Care Leavers under supervision have access to good information and support as well as improving the knowledge of those who work in the newly formed Care Leavers Service and strengthening that of Youth Justice Workers. The second post holder is focused on those children who are Looked After and known to Youth Justice particularly those who are remanded. The Head of the Service is a member of the Corporate Parenting Panel and regularly updates all partners on progress to keep Looked After Children out of the criminal justice system.   
                             
The work with the local Magistrates Court is now a shared responsibility between 5 Local Authorities who use the shared facilities and support in the courts situated in Manchester. All are represented on the Greater Manchester Court Users forum which meets quarterly and works to highlight barriers and identify ways to improve the work of the courts and partners who provide services within it. 
Strategically, the Youth Justice Service is well placed to access, engage and plan partnership working. The Service is represented by the Head of Service on a wide range of partnership boards and contributes to their action plans and strategic direction.  These include Manchester's: 
 
? Children's Safeguarding Board 
? Serious Case Review Sub-Group 
? Complex Safeguarding Sub-Group 
? Transitions Board 
? Community Safety Board 
? Community Safety Core Group 
? Serious Organised Crime Executive 
? Prevent Board 
? Corporate Parenting Panel 
? Public Health and Serious Violence Group 
 
The collaborative approach taken by the Greater Manchester Youth Justice Services is outlined in a Strategic Plan which is now under review - see Appendix 4.  Outcomes from this joint work include the joint commissioning of a Greater Manchester 
Appropriate Adult Service, the embedding of a new approach to Out of Court work, Peer Review and training resource as well as access to funding through the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) which has been used to fund training on the management of Sexually Harmful Behaviour and the Safeguarding Social Worker post at HMYOI Wetherby. 
 
The strategic influence of the Service has been strengthened through joint discussions and planning with GMCA. The Head of Service is a member of the new Greater Manchester Youth Justice Transformation Board which is focused on the development of a 'child-friendly policing approach' as well as the implementation of the Dept. of Education's new 'Protocol on Reducing the Unnecessary Criminalisation of Looked After Children and Care Leavers'. The Head of Service represents the Greater Manchester Youth Justice Heads on the Greater Manchester Health and Justice Board and is influencing the new Health and Justice Delivery Plan to ensure that future commissioning of services are in line with the needs of those children known to Youth Justice across the region. Some of the key elements of this work are being tested out in an NHS England Collaborative Commissioning Networks Project which is providing additional Speech and Language as well as the opportunity to pilot the Do-it-Profiler tool to identify neuro-disability at an earlier stage in assessments. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion: 
In summary, Manchester Youth Justice Service continues to work with colleagues and partners to reduce re-offending, protect the public and keep vulnerable children and victims safe.  2018/19 has been a challenging year with the arrival of the HMI Joint Inspection team in October, the subsequent report and recommendations which have shaped much of the focus of the service in the months following.   The priorities for this year will build on the good practice highlighted by inspectors and the positive results in reduced re-offending rates and the early signs of success in the new Out of Court Triage processes.  Future delivery of Youth Justice Services will continue to be integrated with those of Social Work, Complex Safeguarding, Early Help, the Care Leavers Service and Education within Children's Services as well as our partners from the public, private and voluntary sectors.  We will work to strengthen the impact of the services provided and the outcomes for children and young people in the criminal justice system.

MANCHESTER YOUTH JUSTICE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
 
Terms of Reference 
  
1. Purpose/Remit 
 The Youth Justice Management Board is a partnership which includes, but also extends beyond, the direct delivery of youth justice (YJ) services.  In order to deliver the right outcomes, YJ must be equally linked into Children's Services and the Criminal Justice System and makes appropriate contributions to each agenda.  The YJ Management Board is a partnership which has responsibility for ensuring an appropriate balance is achieved in relation to both areas.  It is strategically linked to the Community Safety Partnership, 
Children's Board and MSCB. Performance accountability is via Manchester Children's 
Services which involves performance and assurance monitoring, in addition to scrutiny from Manchester City Council elected members via the Executive and Scrutiny Committee arrangement.  These arrangements involve annual reporting and performance/assurance reporting on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. 
 
This dual approach will ensure the YJ Service is able to coordinate and deliver an effective service to children and young people and their families, victims and the local community with the principle aim of preventing and reducing youth crime and factors that place young people at risk of offending. 
 
The principle strategic aims of youth justice services as identified by the Youth Justice Board are: 
  
? Prevent offending 
? Reduce re-offending 
? Ensure the safe and effective use of custody 
? Increase victim and public confidence 
Wales) 
The YJ Management Board will ensure that the Service carries out its key functions with children and young people on the edge of or within the criminal justice system including: 
  
? Engagement in education, training and employment 
? Access to suitable accommodation provision 
? Access to substance misuse services 
? Access to health services 
? Reduction in re-offending 
? Reduction of first time entrants 
? Reduction in the use of custody 
? Reduction in the disproportionate representation of BME young people in the Youth Justice System 
  
2. Function 
The role of the YJ Management Board is to ensure that YJ delivers its principal aim of preventing offending and re-offending by young people. Membership will comprise of all statutory partners (Police, NPS, Health and Social Care) and other agencies (e.g. Community Rehabilitation Company, Education, Courts, Third Sector organisations) that can make a significant contribution to this agenda. Members will be officers or representatives with sufficient seniority to be able to commit resources and take necessary decisions. The YJ 
Appendix 3: Terms of Reference for Manchester YJ Management Board 
Management Board will be chaired by the Director of Children's Services. The Deputy Chair will be the Assistant Chief Executive from the National Probation Service. 
  
Board members take corporate ownership of YJ and the youth crime prevention agenda. Members will be equipped with sufficient knowledge of youth justice to understand the performance challenges. Individual members will promote the youth crime prevention agenda, as appropriate, in other partnership groups. 
The YJ Management Board will ensure that the YJ Service is adequately resourced and infrastructure needs are addressed. This will include periodic reviews of resource requirements, ensuring where possible equitable contributions from partner agencies (funding and in-kind). 
 
The YJ Management Board will actively monitor YJ performance and takes corrective action in response to under-performance. The Board will ensure that all duties, requirements and responsibilities around safeguarding children and young people at risk of offending are fulfilled by all partnership agencies.  The Board will also actively ensure that young people known to YJ can access mainstream services. 
 
The YJ Management Board will oversee the YJ business planning process and the commissioning of local services. This will include approving the Youth Justice Plan and monitoring delivery, to ensure that aggregated performance data is used to inform planning and commissioning locally, regionally and nationally as required.

Youth Justice in Greater Manchester  
 
Introduction 
 
The Youth Justice strategic leaders in Greater Manchester have worked together in Youth Justice since their inception circa 1998 - 2000.  As a group, we have seen increasing opportunities to have a voice, influence partner organisations and to collaborate in order to achieve better outcomes for children, young people and their families as well as victims, courts, police and those who are part of the criminal justice system. 
We have seen a steady reduction in the number of children in Greater Manchester who are charged with offences and appear at court. This is in line with a national trend and gives Youth Justice Services an opportunity to focus interventions on those young people who present the greatest risks and challenge within the criminal justice system.  We have also seen a significant reduction in the numbers of children locally who are sent to custody so more of those who do appear at court are managed through the use of community-based interventions.  The youth justice landscape locally is complex and fast changing and with good integrated working between partners, there is now a stronger response to and recognition of the challenges that some young people do present. 
Together with our partners, we have a much greater understanding of the complex safeguarding issues that make the children and young people vulnerable to committing crime. We also recognise the need to engage at an early stage in prevention work to address need and issues of risk as soon as possible to prevent a pattern of criminal behaviour from being established.  
 
 
Youth Justice in Greater Manchester is complex, ever changing and highly relevant in social care and criminal justice.  We have established a strong partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University Centre for Youth Studies and highly value the research opportunities that have come from this as well as providing real-life practical experience of Youth Justice for students in Greater Manchester. 
 
We have worked with partners in Greater Manchester Combined Authority and we have specifically supported the project team in  
? Wetherby YOI - developing a Safeguarding Social Worker post  
? Health, liaison and diversion scheme in police custody suites and at court 
? The development of a new approach to assessment and early intervention of Out of Court Disposals   ? Data Sharing agreements 
? Sexually Harmful Behaviour training 
? Exploring Problem solving approaches at court 
? Secure Schools 
? A new approach to Health and Justice 
  
 
 
A Combined Approach to Quality Improvement Across Greater Manchester 
When looking ahead, Greater Manchester Strategic Leaders leads see the challenges in the coming year as complex as ever and agree these include: 
? Safeguarding of children in custody  
? Changing demands of the Greater Manchester Courts  
? Improving the impact and reach of work with victims 
? Embedding a new approach to Out of Court Disposals 
? Preparation, planning and readiness for inspection 
? Future funding and resource allocations 
? Addressing disproportionality within the Youth Justice caseload 
 
 
Priorities in 2018/19 
Continuing to maintain high standards and improve on current practice will support preparation for future inspections is a priority.  Work will start to plan, prepare and benchmark all Greater Manchester Youth Justice Services against the newly published HMIP inspection framework.  Services in Greater Manchester will also want to evaluate current work and respond to the priorities highlighted in the YJB and Youth Custody Service' strategic priorities  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-justice-board-for-england-and-wales-strategic-plan-2018-21 https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprobation/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/04/Youth-offending-standards-March-18final.pdf 
Our joint priorities also reflect the priorities outlined in the 'Standing Together' Plan https://www.greatermanchesterca.gov.uk/info/20006/safer_and_stronger_communities/82/police_and_crime_plan/1 with a focus on improving youth justice services impact on reducing harm and offending through early intervention and rehabilitation 
The positive outcomes achieved from collaborative working in Youth Justice across Greater Manchester to date provides a strong foundation upon which to build and to address these challenges and priorities. It provides a good opportunity for developing creative and innovative ways of working with partners and stakeholders to improve the quality of services and deliver better outcomes for children and young people in the region. We will continue to build on our partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University to research and evaluate our work so that we can build a strong body of evidence of what is working and to improve the quality of delivery to children and young people in Greater Manchester. 
 
All of these priorities are driving work in each Local Authority and having the opportunity to share knowledge, experience and good practice across the Services as well as having a joint voice in national and Greater Manchester forums, strengthens the work of all Youth Justice Services.   
 
Whilst each Youth Justice Service has a statutory Business Plan with targets and objectives, the Youth Justice Strategic Leads have set themselves a challenge to work jointly to achieve three joint objectives in 2018/19.  These relate to specific projects that can only or are best delivered by all Services. 
Greater Manchester Youth Justice Joint Actions Key Objectives for 2018/19 
Key Objective How Who When 1.
