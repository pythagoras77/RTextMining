SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
Foreword by Superintendent David Hall, Chair of the North East Lincolnshire Youth Crime Board 

I have pleasure in presenting the reviewed and updated North East Lincolnshire's Youth Justice Plan for 2018 - 2020. This plan details our commitment to supporting children to live safe, successful lives and to reduce their involvement in the criminal justice system. It sets out the priorities for the North East Lincolnshire Youth Offending Service, how partners will work together to build on the strong picture in North East Lincolnshire and plans for further developing youth offending services.
This plan also provides a review of the progress and successes achieved over the first year of the plan and looks forward to how, with partners, the team will continue to deliver improved outcomes for some of our more vulnerable young people steering them from offending behaviour into positive and constructive activities so that they can contribute to the communities they live in, have high aspirations and achieve their potential.
The North East Lincolnshire Youth Offending Service continues to provide services that make a difference for young people, their families and the community as a whole. There is a continued focus on prevention from offending and working with children and their families to help them address the issues that lead to children and young people becoming involved with criminal and anti-social behaviour.
The North East Lincolnshire Youth Offending Services success can be seen in the improved outcomes it has achieved and have continued during the implementation of this plan:
* Re-offending has continued to reduce however higher than the Humberside and National average.
* First time entrants also continue to be at its lowest recorded level.
* We have maintained the reduction in the number of young people who are sentenced to custody.
* Young people living in suitable accommodation at the end of their order has remained strong during 2017/18
* Prevention and out of court disposals continue to be a high proportion of cases.
* All victims of crime are contacted as part of all out of court disposals
Although much has been achieved our aspirations continue to be to achieve more and ensure that communities are safe places to live without fear of crime, to provide opportunities and further improve the outcomes for children in North East Lincolnshire and continue to reduce the number of children who become involved in the youth justice system

* Who we are and what we do
* Summary of achievements
* Any major in-year changes to governance or service delivery
* Any innovative or promising practice
* The partnership's response to thematic inspection reports published in the previous twelve months.
In October 2017 the 0-19 re-structure brought changes to the previous structure of the Youth Offending Service (YOS) and other early help services in North East Lincolnshire Council (NELC) to create a system to reduce levels of vulnerability and an ever increasing reliance to high cost services.

The NELC YOS, statutory provision, sits within Young and Safe Service area of Children's Services Prevention and Early Help (PEH) offer and delivers a range of services to prevent offending and re-offending by young people. Young and Safe also includes youth engagement teams including Duke Of Edinburgh, outdoor learning services, street based targeted youth services and services to reduce violence against women and girls.

The domain around out of court disposals sits within locality services, previously known as Family Hubs, to ensure a whole family approach is utilised to fully support the young person through early help assessments and aims to prevent first time entrants to the justice system through working holistically on any associated vulnerabilities. North East Lincolnshire recognise the young person as a child first and not an offender. Statutory and non-statutory services provide a seamless youth justice service within North East Lincolnshire to ensure the below performance measures are safely reduced.

* First Time Entrants (FTE) to the Justice system
* Re Offending rates, both binary and frequency
* Custody
* Youth related Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB)
* Young People involved in crime

The Youth Offending Service is now fully embedded within Prevention and Early Help services with integrated working and early intervention and prevention at the heart of its delivery. The  YOS  remains as a recognisable feature within this structure and  continues  to deliver all of its statutory functions
The principal aim of the Youth Offending Service is to prevent offending by children and young persons by:
* Confronting young offenders with the consequences of their offending and helping them to develop a sense of personal responsibility. 
* Intervention which tackles the risk factors associated with offending - personal, family, social, educational, health, drugs, accommodation, peer group pressure, low self esteem, poor academic attainment etc. 
* Punishment  proportionate to seriousness and persistence of offending, with a range of penalties available to the Courts (referral orders, Youth Rehabilitation Orders and Custody
* Encouraging reparation to victims or to the community by young offenders. 
* Reinforcing the responsibilities of parents
* Working in Partnership with a range of Criminal Justice agencies 
* Working in Partnership with a range of Voluntary and Community Sector agencies to encourage income generation to facilitate a wider range of positive activity interventions for young people within YOS. 
The work undertaken by the teams falls mainly within the following areas;
* Preventative Work 
* Pre-court Diversion 
* Court Attendance and Bail Supervision 
* Referral Orders 
* Youth Rehabilitation Orders 
* Custodial Sentences and Supervision on License 
* Multi-agency approach
* Integrated Offender Management
* Preventing and tackling exploitation of young people both criminal and sexual exploitation.
* Preventing and tackling the recruitment and grooming of young people in relation to violent extremism

The merger of services brought numerous enhancements in relation to those identified at risk and vulnerable. Young and Safe Services deliver a broad ranges of services including the Youth Offending Service and ;-
* Street Based Youth Work
* Domestic Abuse
* Sexual Health
* Positive/ Adventurous Activities
* Raising Aspirations
* Prevention of Violent Extremism
* Young Carers project

NELC YOS performance

There are approximately 14,543 10-17 year olds living in North East Lincolnshire (Oct 2017 data). Over the 12 month period January 2018 - December 2018, 25 young people have entered the Criminal Justice system for the first time with a rate of 172 per 100,000 population

The Re-Offending rates in North East Lincolnshire are high, which potentially is a bi product of low FTE numbers. The rates are split into 3 performance measures

1.	Binary rate (% of re offenders, within current cohort of offenders)
2.	Rate of offences committed by re offenders within cohort (frequency rate)

The picture in North East Lincolnshire at Q1 19/20, taken from a reporting period April 17 - June 17 cohort

1.	Binary rate = 54.9%
2.	Frequency rate = 3.50

Previously Re Offending Q1 19/20 taken from a reporting period April 17 - June 17

1.	Binary rate = 55.9%
2.	Frequency rate = 5.90

North East Lincolnshire YOS have a challenging cohort of young offenders and this made difficult with an extremely low number of young people as an FTE and a low number of young people going into custody, NEL are dedicated to working with young people within the community.

Whilst Youth Justice Board (YJB) figures are 2 years in arears the current NELC YOS live tracking  tool shows better re offending performance figures binary rate of 36.7%, Re Offences per offender 3.69 and frequency rate = 1.66

YOS and partners within Police, National Probation Services (NPS) and the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) have recently developed a "turn the curve" exercise in respect to Re Offending, which has delivered a 10 point plan to effectively reduce the current rates.

In 2018/2019 the Youth Offending Service dealt with approximately 75 open cases, In the last 12 months 6 young people have been given Detention and Training Orders; however YOS will always advocate for the child to be supervised within the community however robust decisions always made with the priority being the safety of the child and the protection of the public.

Young and Safe youth engagement team contribute to the reduction of youth related ASB within the borough alongside other partnership agencies. 2018 /2019 showed 1approximately 1300 calls for service relating to youth related ASB, 

PREVENTION 

Over the last 12 months the service has worked hard to ensure that the Out of Court Disposals model continued to be supported by appropriate structures and Partners to ensure a successful delivery. Both North and North East Lincolnshire Council worked closely with Humberside Police to deliver a South Humberside model which has provided consistency in decision making and outcomes for young people. Local and National data suggest that the process has been successful and further reductions have been made in the number of young people made in the Young People entering the criminal justice system for the first time.

All young people who come through the process undergo thorough assessment and risk management processes. Over the last 12 months this has been supported further through the development of Liaison and diversion services in partnership with local organisation Navigo and funded by NHS England. This provides support and screening at the earliest point and further enhances support and diversion from the criminal justice system.

Over the past year the YOS has continued to work closely in partnership with Humberside Police, Youth engagement services both universal and targeted, Health services including school nursing and mental health services, Professional sporting clubs such as Grimsby Town Sports and Educational Trust and Safer and the Community Safety Partnership to continue to ensure that there is a wide range of positive activities available to Young People. The activities are aimed at young people in or at risk of becoming involved in the criminal justice system and are focussed on areas led by intelligence on ASB and crime. The sessions are also responsive and mobile and can be quickly delivered to newly identified areas.  Further reductions in ASB are evident as a result of this work.

Over the last 3 years excellent work on the Child sexual exploitation has been developed. Over the last 12 months close working relationships between YOS and Young and Safe staff has led to improved identification of and support to those young people identified as at risk in relation to offending and at risk exploitation. This has been a significant indicator justifying the decision to merge prevention and statutory services.
There have also been significant developments in relation to Child Criminal Exploitation, particularly in reference to young people involved in drug trafficking, County lines and Modern day Slavery. Partnerships have been formed to develop a multi -agency response which include practice development, identification, managing risk of individuals and workforce development. Further work is planned in all of these areas to ensure that an approach that is robust and embedded. All of this work has been supported by the LSCB. 
Working more closely with Street based youth Provision has increased the sharing of intelligence, improved the monitoring and compliance of offenders, supported improved risk and vulnerability management and supported the early identification of those young people who are in the early stages of developing a criminal profile.
The PREVENT agenda is well embedded at a strategic and operational level within the YOS. The Service manager is a member of the Silver Prevent group and also attends the Channel Panel. All YOS staff has undertaken training workshops in relation to Prevent and are familiar with the recognition of risk factors as well as being confident in assessment and referral processes.
REDUCING RE-OFFENDING 
Over the past 12 months the service has maintained a clear focus on further improvement. It has continued the development of offender management programmes both on a group and an individual level. Risk and vulnerability management processes remain integral to the management of offenders and the development and delivery of intervention plans. The seconded Probation Officer is central to this process and brings challenge and oversight to weekly Signs of Safety panel meetings. 

The service has completed some specific work utilising the Re-Offending live tracking tool and has conducted exercises utilising an Outcomes Based Accountability model to develop further plan to reduce re-offending, this refreshed in June 2018 through a further turn the curve exercise with attendance from all relevant partnership agencies including YOS, National Probation Services (NPS), Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) and Humberside Police. This has led to the development of more integrated and locality working within schools, Family Hubs and family homes. Approaches utilising CBT, supported by clinical supervision have also been a new addition to provision. The development of a localised Freedom programme which incorporates physical exercise, therapeutic approaches and supports family strengths is also a new group approach to supporting desistance to those young people most at risk of re-offending and exploitation. The delivery of this programme of activities is done so by staff from the youth element of Young and Safe, utilising bush craft and youth work skills to engage with the young people. 

The Ministry of Justice performance reporting demonstrates that the service is struggling to make improvements in relation re-offending binary rates and offences per re-offender (frequency). . Whilst the total number of offenders in the cohort and the number of re-offences committed continued to fall, the service recognises that further improvement is needed in this area. It must be noted that as more and more young people are diverted from Criminal justice system the small number of young people remaining have extremely complex backgrounds and are at significant risk of re-offending. The service however does not use this as an excuse and continues to look at innovative ways of engaging with young people to support desistance and recidivism. 

The Service continues its engagement within the Integrated Offender Management process which supports a partnership approach to managing prolific and high risk offenders. This approach continues to have a significant effect on the reduction of serious acquisitive crime and has been extended to consider violent repeat offenders.  This process has clearly improved integrated working. The service has strong working relationships and has enabled the team to more closely support and monitor those young people most at risk of re-offending. 
Non statutory support continues to be offered to young people deemed high risk not on statutory orders. This is also proving effective as in reducing offending.

The Harmful Sexualised Behaviour Panel continues to be the mechanism in assisting agencies to work together to ensure that young people are appropriately assessed, risk managed and supported. Large cross sections of staff have received AIM2 training and multi agency joint assessment is resulting in balanced and agreed outcomes. Strong relationships with the NCPCC to ensure that joint assessments are completed which lead to robust intervention programmes which offer alternatives to custody and incorporate therapeutic support and intervention. The Turning the Page Programme is an excellent example of this. This local arrangement has been nationally recognised and is currently being monitored by the NSPCC as area of good practice with a view to wider implementation. 

COURT / CUSTODY
Over the past 12 months the YOS has continued to develop its alternatives to custody both in relation to bail and remand and direct alternatives in respect of sentencing. It is worthy of note that the impact of the LASPO Act has supported the reduction in the use of remands which has led to a reduction in the use of custodial sentences. We have improved our quality in relation to Pre-sentence reporting in an attempt to ensure that only those young people that cannot be managed in the community are sentenced to custody. Good professional working relationships with court and other professional have been central to this.  The YOS / Court protocol has recently been refreshed to ensure effective and on-going positive relationships are continued.

The service has continued to make further developments in the relation of secure remands and the changes brought about by LASPO. The use of a variety of approaches including ISS bail packages. Foster placements and supported lodgings have enabled the service to manage the number of remand and provide alternatives to custody where appropriate.

Feed back from court user groups continues to indicate that YOS representation and reporting in the court arena reflect a high standard of professionalism.  Specific exercises delivered by YOS officers have been undertaken to reassure the courts that the Out of Court Disposals process is dealing with the appropriate offences at appropriate levels. Feedback has been delivered on reoffending rates and compliance. 

INSPECTION /AUDIT

The YOS was subject to Short Quality Screening in June of 2014. The following comment appeared as the summary of the resulting Inspection 
"Overall, we found a very positive picture in North East Lincolnshire. There had been a considerable improvement in performance from the strong position identified in our last inspection. Staff were producing high quality assessments and plans, and providing an effective service for children and young people, and the community. Management oversight was good and staff felt supported.
There is room for improvement in ensuring that reviews are completed quickly in response to significant changes".
The supporting data charts that were supplied with the report illustrated that the service scored over 90% in all 4 areas of inspection. 
The YOS were also involved a thematic inspection on the resettlement of young females. There were numerous highlights to these reports but also areas of learning which were immediately addressed.
Cross Authority case auditing processes have been arranged and undertaken between North and North East Lincs YOT's. Each YOS audits 3 cases per quarter for the neighbouring service using a specific audit tool which reflects that used of part of a formal inspection process. YJB National standards audit has been completed and peer audits have been introduced amongst the team.  Feedback is given to Operational staff and managers as well as to each YOT Management Board. 
ACCOMMODATION 
The YOS young people's intensive supportive lodgings scheme continues to be well utilised.  The placements are shared between YOS and Through care (LAC) with a significant element of funding coming from Supporting People.  This scheme provides six placements, alongside high elements of support around life skills, self-care, accessing education and employment in preparation for independent living.  The placements assist with resettlement, bail and remand as well as more general homelessness issues.

VOLUNTEERS
The service has continued to develop its volunteer programme and build on its success following the receipt of the Investors in Volunteers award for a further 3 years.  The variety of opportunities for volunteers continues to include Referral Order panels, Appropriate Adult duty, mentoring and ISS. The role of Independent Visitor for 'Looked After' Children has been added in the last 12 months. The YOS Summer Arts Project also offered new opportunities.  Approximately 31 volunteers currently support the service. Many of them have been involved for a number of years. In 2016 a member of the volunteer team was nominated and selected as one of thirty National Ambassadors to Volunteering at the 30th annual celebration of Volunteer week. All volunteers have also been trained alongside the staff team in restorative practices and conferencing. 

Transition to adulthood
The Youth Offending Service is committed to working with partners to ensure a smooth transition that addresses the welfare needs of young people and continued access to appropriate services and interventions wherever possible to manage the increasing cohort of older teenagers in the youth justice system.
• The YOS aims for young people over 17 on orders extending beyond their 18th birthday on appropriate orders, and where transfer to adult services is deemed to better meet their needs to be subject to transition meetings and receive continued support where appropriate.
• Processes and procedures have been updated and the new probation structure (NPS and CRC) have identified dedicated officers from each service to manage the transitioning cases.

SECTION 2: STRUCTURES AND GOVERNANCE

*  Holding the service to account for its practice 
*  Monitoring and meeting Grant conditions set out in any grant made by the YJB, e.g. timely submission of data, compliance with secure estate placement information, 
* completion of national standards audits and procedures for reviewing community safeguarding and public protection incidents 
*  Supporting the YOT in overcoming barriers to effective multi agency working
The Youth Offending service sits within Prevention and Early Help Services in North East Lincs Council. Specifically located within Young and Safe Service area alongside early intervention and prevention services. The YOS is overseen by a local management board made up of statutory and other relevant partners who contribute to the overall delivery and scrutiny of youth justice services within the locality. The board meets on a quarterly basis where support and scrutiny is provided on such issues as performance against national measures, completions of national standards audits, and any others returns required by the YJB. Financial contributions and spend against these is also a key aspect of scrutiny at board meetings.

The terms of reference of the local management board have been refreshed and membership is to be reviewed annually. It is the intention of the YOS management board to ensure
1. Board members are of sufficient seniority to address any issues/barriers to delivery
2. The board sets the direction, strategy and action planning relating to YOS
3. The board include all statutory and non-statutory partners to ensure value is added to the work of YOS
4. The board members are active in their attendance and participation and to recognise the contribution their own agency makes to the YOS
5. The board members advocate the work of the YOS in their broader roles
6. The board understands the expected performance relating to the 3 youth justice outcomes and holds the YOS management team to account.
7. The board has confidence that a shared and collective outcomes framework amongst agencies is the cornerstone for achieving success in partnership working.
8. The board understand current vulnerabilities faced by young people and are confident that whilst these themes are governed elsewhere the YOS board have a responsibility to have understanding on the impact it has within YOS
9. The board has confidence in the financial resources within YOS
Following on from the support provided by the Youth Justice Board the Management Board is now operating with improved attendance and focus. The revamping terms of reference the development of an induction programme for new board members have supported this process. 
SECTION 3: RESOURCES AND VALUE FOR MONEY

* a structure chart and information on the following:
     Financial Plan
     staffing by agency
staffing by gender and ethnicity
volunteers by gender and ethnicity
* Resources used to prepare for and implementation of Asset Plus



* Confirmation of compliance with the minimum staffing requirements set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 
The appendices attached at the end of this document A, B, C, D,  address all requirements in relation to financial planning staff and in kind contributions and staff/volunteer gender and ethnicity breakdown. These are 









In relation to the previous youth crime plan and the implementation of ASSET+ the YOS have now been using this system for approximately 2 years with all staff both in post and pre court confident of its completion and on-going data recording. The ASSET+ system through Child View is regularly reviewed and training offered through CACI, the training made available to YOS staff, Business Admin staff and ICT staff to ensure a cohesive process of recording and data cleansing relating to accurate performance reporting.



The YOS complies with the minimum staffing requirements and has a full time seconded police officer, a part time probation officer, a part time ETE officer and access to school nursing, mental health services through Future Minds Matter (formerly CAMHS) and drug and substance services through AD Action. To add to this the NELC Prevention and Early Help offer brings together all elements of children's services to ensure all children are supported for as long as needed and with whatever resources, interventions are needed.
The next steps within North East Lincolnshire Council are to create a Safer NEL service area to include the Local Safeguarding for Children Board (LSCB), Community Safety Partnership and YOS to create an umbrella over all elements of risk and vulnerability and to hold other services to account to ensure the best outcomes for children in North East Lincolnshire.
SECTION 4 : PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS

* YOS links to, and relationships with, other key service delivery providers




*  Commissioning arrangements that are intended to secure improvements against the three youth justice outcomes. 



* YOS  links to Troubled Families  and other arrangements aimed at supporting children from high risk or vulnerable groups

*  YOS approach to ensuring young people leaving custody are effectively resettled The YOS has a range of protocols and service level agreements which are regularly updated and form the clarity required in relation to partner provision. These include the below which have all been refreshed in June 2018.

* YOS / CASS protocol
* YOS / LAC protocol
* YOS / NPS / CRC transition protocol (National and local appendix)
* YOS / Court protocol
* YOS Children's Health protocol
* YOS / SEND protocol
* YOS victims policy for both out of court and statutory cases


The YOS works closely with the Through care team to ensure that looked after children are supported appropriately in relation to secure remands and remands to the local authority and in order to prevent the inappropriate criminalisation of young people in care. The development of a YOS Triage process in partnership with the Police, Fostering and Adoption, Through care and Residential provision is having a positive impact on decision making and outcomes for Looked After Children
There is a good flow of information from YOS to child protection services and attendance at appropriate meetings. A board member at assistant director level is also responsible for the governance of the LSCB. There are also excellent partner relationships which support the safeguarding of young people with particular reference to Child Sexual Exploitation, Child Criminal Exploitation, Sexual Harmful Behaviour and the prevention of violent extremism. 

The YOS has a strong relationship with the Troubled Families agenda. The lead officer for troubled families is a board member and there is a systematic approach to the identification of troubled families within the locality. YOS is central to the identification and management of the plans supporting these families and their local communities. 





The youth offending service have a key re-settlement programme and this is led by an operational manager. Re-settlement is key to sentence planning when in custody and the utilisation of partner agencies throughout the custodial element of the sentence is key to the transition back to the community.

Case managers work with accommodation providers, education providers and substance misuse services to ensure that all services and interventions are in place upon the young person's return to the community. ROTL has previously been used in order for young people to attend interviews at college accommodation interviews prior toothier return to the community. 

Custody case managers work closely with the high risk team for individuals who are to be released on intensive licence conditions and dual attendance at planning meetings takes place. Frequently planning meetings are also attended by education and accommodation providers from the home area to aid relationship building and knowledge of the case. 

IRS is offered to all young people leaving custody and a voluntary period of support is always offered following the end of the official licence period. 


SECTION 5: RISKS TO FUTURE DELIVERY AGAINST THE YOUTH JUSTICE OUTCOME MEASURES

*  Emerging or continuing concerns about improvements against the three youth justice outcomes measures 
* Any planned service reviews, self-assessments or audits that the service intends to undertake, including those related to thematic inspection findings.
*  Responding to the diverse needs of children and young people in contact with your services and any known disproportionality concerns.
 








* Reduce secure remands to a minimum.
Reductions in local authority spending combined with the restructuring continue to present significant challenges to the local authority. This year's finances are almost wholly dedicated to staff based within the local authority to ensure that the partnership delivered upon it statutory responsibilities whilst allowing for innovation and creativity on new and emerging trends locally. Any further reductions in funding will immediately relate to a reduction in partnership staff. Whilst there was a small reduction in the number of cases dealt with in 16/17 there seems to be a small rise amount of disposals since the beginning of this financial year. It is absolutely key that services are allowed and supported to focus on early intervention and prevention in order to get upstream of the complex statutory client group that YOS generally deals with. Any reduction in funding will also result in some activity having to cease. It can only be assumed that statutory duties continue to take a priority and that the very valuable work that the partnership is currently involved in in relation to CSE, Criminal Exploitation, Organised Crime, Gangs and Youth Violence, Triage and the delivery of Community Resolutions would have to be reviewed. The key concern in relation to this possibility is that the progress that has been made in relation to early identification would stop because statutory responsibility would become the prime focus. 

A significant amount of time has been spent reviewing past re-offending data, and the utilisation of a live tracking tool is part of the forthcoming years attempt to address what continues to be a challenge to the authority. Recent quarters demonstrate some improvement in rates of re-offending but the partnership recognise that further improvement is necessary and are committed to achieving this. To this end a specific feature of this year's activity will be centred on outcome based accountability and paying particular attention to what works best with our cohort of young people. 

Current case data shows that that approximately 47 % (16 / 34) of the current open case load is also either Child Protection, Child in Need or Looked After. A review of joint working with the Child Assessment and Safeguarding service has taken place and plans are in place the align resources to create greater consistency, improve planning and reduce duplication.

What has been a consistent concern raised by all YOS staff over the last 12 months is the amount of time that practitioners are spending on Asset Plus assessments. Some practitioners reported that almost 70% of their time was spent completing assessment and reviews. This is not an appropriate use of practitioner's time. In light of reducing resources and finances an urgent review of this area of work is required. 

As noted within the inspection report from 2014 diversity is central to any assessment undertaken with young people open to or entering the criminal justice system. Plans and intervention programmes are tailored to address these diverse needs.

Success has been achieved in keeping custodial remands to a minimum, a significant achievement given the difficulties previously faced by the authority in this area. Targeted specific programmes of sufficient intensity which are robustly delivered and managed by the high risk team and improved relationships with the courts have contributed to these improvements. 

A continued drive to raise awareness with partner agencies about the importance of their contribution to this agenda will help ensure that this continues. 


SECTION 6 PRIORITIES FOR 2018/19

In 2017 North East Lincolnshire Council continued to make progress with the Creating Strong Communities project. The project was funded by a Social care innovation bid incorporates development in 4 key areas of practice as illustrated below: The 4 key areas as identified above were considered to have a firm fit in terms of Youth Justice and will continue be applied to the three priority performance areas in the coming 12 months.





In line with the above the local authority has completed the development of the 0-19 programme. The core purpose of the programme is to keep improving outcomes for children so they thrive and are safe.  The 0-19 Programme will be the delivery mechanism for the new Prevention and Early Help by sustainably rebalancing children's services by focusing on prevention and reducing demand to social care and other high cost services.
Phase one of this redesign has been successfully  completed and takes in all Early Intervention and  Prevention services, one of which is Young and Safe which incorporates the YOS. The following priorities are central to the new delivery.

* Delivering an integrated approach to areas of high demand as defined by local partnership data with a focus on the 3 identified core drivers of demand, drug and substance misuse, domestic abuse, poor parental mental health.
* Improving the way we listen and respond to children, young people and their families
* Working with some families for longer to support sustainable change and resilience 
* Updating skills of the workforce to be able to more effectively respond to the issues most affecting families. Staff across all agencies require core skills in:
o Identifying and responding to domestic abuse 
o Identifying and responding to substance misuse
o Emotional Health Support
o Assertiveness and persistence with hard to reach families
* The council needs to invest in partnerships, not just through board meetings but through one to one relationships to build shared values and outcomes
* Improving communication with staff and partners to help develop the understanding of Early Help and give clarity around responsibilities
* Seeking opportunities to align resources and join up commissioning including commissioning different specialist support and services around the core issues that drive demand
* Developing our digital capabilities and offer to ensure that a broader section  of the community are can engage through technology
* Improving working with schools to ensure that we are making the most of our opportunities and resources together, to ensure children and young people and their families have the best chances to succeed. 

The Youth Offending partnership will play a key role in supporting the development in this integrated approach.






Current performance data


First time entrants are at an all time low with only 25 young people entering the criminal justice system in a rolling 12 month period Jan 18 - Dec 18. Our rate per 100,00 is 172 lower than the rates in Yorkshire (244), Humberside PCC area (243) and England and Wales (236)
Re Offending rates have reduced from the last reporting period, from 55.9% to 54.9%


Re Offences per re offender has dramatically reduced from 5.79 offences per re offender to 3.50


Rates of custody have also gone down when comparing to April 17 - March 18 / April 18 - March 19

Ending gang and youth violence (Child Criminal Exploitation, County Lines and Modern Day Slavery)

In November 2015 North East Lincs were subject to an Ending Gang and Youth Violence Peer Review. This occurred following a rise in the number of associated assaults and injuries in relation to aspects of organised crime and drug dealing in the area. The review highlighted a number of areas were partners could better work together to both reduce risks to a number of vulnerable Children whilst tackling organised crime. The resulting action plan was significantly developed through multi agency over the next few years and in April 2018 the Home Office conducted a further locality review.
This was a well-informed locality review that had clearly taken steps to identify and address this issue based on successfully implementing a number of the recommendations from the previous EGYV peer review in 2015. 
* The partnership appears strong and well informed. This strong collaboration has helped to identify the emergence of county lines and highlight the cross over between this, the modern slavery agenda and CCE. The arrival of gang/group offenders from Manchester, Merseyside, London and West Midlands has increased the risk around CSE, violence and vulnerability linked to adults, young people, and drug debt and cuckooing. 
* The close working relationship between middle management in the local authority and the police was clear to see with some excellent examples of good practice highlighted during the review. 
* The current multi-agency needs assessment requires a more detailed understanding of what exactly is happening in terms of drug usage, distribution, use of children, gender, cuckooing etc. is required. 
* The activity around county lines is dynamic and although such an assessment will only provide a snapshot, this is crucial in terms of allocating resources and tackling the problem.
* The local focus on CE and CCE is to be commended and is good practice during a time when many areas are struggling to interpret gangs, groups and OCGs we find it tends to stifle activity that could actually tackle this problem. 


There have been significant developments in North East Lincolnshire in relation to Child Criminal Exploitation, particularly in reference to young people involved in drug trafficking, county lines and Modern day Slavery. Partnerships have been formed to develop a multi -agency response which include practice development, identification, managing risk of individuals and workforce development. To assist with this the NELC Youth Offending Services have dedicated the below developments. 

* NELC have seconded an allocated CCE link practitioner to provide a first point of access for all practitioners to report any concerns in relation to CCE and to offer support, advice and guidance.
* Ensure intelligence sharing with Police and other key partners to support building of a wider picture of the issues the area faces in regards to OCG's and County Lines. 
* To work directly with individuals and their families identified at MACE and/ or is at risk of exploitation. Targeted work which includes programmes such as 'Which Way'.
* Development of new and innovative programmes of direct work that tackle all areas of exploitation.
* Sharing of concerns with all required professionals e.g. social workers in order to build safeguards for Children Families and the workforce.  
* Attendance at relevant boards / risk management panels to ensure that individual risk/ harm /exploitation levels are assessed.
* Developing the preventative agenda, providing education, training and awareness to schools, partners, parents and families
* To develop group work programmes across the partnership to support the prevention of vulnerability of CCE.
