Foreword
This is the second annual review of the three year Youth Justice Strategy presented in the summer of 2017. This document is a review of the progress made thus far and a plan for further action in the remaining year of the plan. It should be read in conjunction with our three year strategy.
The Southampton Youth Offending Service continues to embrace the vision articulated in the 2018-21 Youth Justice Board strategy in that we also believe
"Every Child should live a safe and crime free life and make a positive contribution to society".
This is consistent with the city's Children and Young People's Strategy which emphasises the importance of children being 'safe and secure' and the Youth Offending Service will continue to strive for positive outcomes by developing and supporting restorative practices both within the Service and with our partners as part of the Local Authority's exciting ambition to become Child Friendly Southampton
The YOS has been supporting the ambition to become a Child Friendly Southampton by encouraging staff to work together to change our way of working by:
* Making connections 
* Valuing families 
* Adopting three mind sets;
o Doing the simple things better
o Remembering that the child is the client
o Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children
* Promote three behaviours;
o listening to the voice of children
o Working restoratively; doing things with families and each other, instead of to them or doing nothing
o using outcome based accountability with a relentless focus on one question:
* Is what we are doing making a difference for a child or children?
Our focus for the remainder of the cycle of this strategy will be to address the new opportunities brought to us by a radically reimagined set of National Standards, supporting local initiatives where our shared ambition intersect and dealing with the challenges faced in tackling the changing nature of offending behaviour in the city and the types of intervention supported by services delivering Youth Justice Services locally.








Section 1: Our Progress So Far

The Vision, Purpose and Principles of the Youth Offending Service remain the same as those presented in the 2017-20 Strategy (Appendix 1). This section is underpinned by these but will specifically focus on;
* progress made so far against our priorities
* response to risk and emerging themes of the last 12 months
* our response to published Inspection Reports during 2018-19
Before detailing this focus it is important to note the successes in the last 12 months;
* Re-offending rates have continued to reduce throughout the year and at the end of Quarter 4 were below both national and regional averages for the first time since disaggregation from Wessex YOT in 2012
* YOS Restorative Practitioners retained the RJC Service Delivery Quality Kite mark for the Service and have rolled out training as part of the SCC Workforce Development Team's "Working with Families" Strategy; linked with the continuing ambition to become a Child Friendly City; this includes delivering basic awareness and practitioner level training to hundreds of staff.
* The YOS has continued to support the development of the Targeted and Restorative Service and worked closely with Inclusion and Diversion Team who supported 144 children throughout the year
* The YOS undertook an important piece of work for the Hampshire and IOW Local Criminal Justice Board detailing the multi-agency response to the Lammy Report into disproportionality in the Criminal Justice System and setting the foundations for the ongoing Police and Crime Commissioner's response to tackling disproportionality locally
* The YOS continued to work collaboratively to address local Serious Youth Violence and successfully acquired YJB funding to undertake a piece of work with Hampshire Constabulary with the ambition of gathering and sharing data across agencies and the county more effectively.
* Establishing improved flows of intelligence led partnership work, including emerging integration with Police Tactical Planning processes and identifying children of most concern.
* The YOS has been integral to the development of a new Cultural Education Partnership, referencing its own endeavours and partnership work in the sector as exemplars the cultural sector can build upon.
The priorities (Appendix 2) for the service continue to be; 
* Reducing Youth Crime
* Reducing First Time Entrants into the youth justice system
* Reducing Re-Offending 
* Reducing Custody

These priorities were developed and endorsed in 2017 and reflected the ambitions of the Safer City Partnership and alignment with the Youth Justice Board's three Key Performance Indicators. Full details of performance over the last 12 months can be found in Appendices 3 and 4. The remainder of this section details how the Service performed in relation to tackling the key actions identified in the 2017-20 Strategy.



Reducing Youth Crime
* Work with partners to respond to recommendations arising from the 2016 National Review of Youth Justice to improve education and economic outcomes.-the YOS and the YOS Management Board have moved beyond the initial focus on the recommendations from this review but we continue to monitor developments at local and national level and incorporate these into the development of local strategies to tackle education and economic outcomes. A focus on the links between part time timetables/exclusions/absence and risks to children of exploitation and/or offending behaviour is now a key driver in this area. The Police and Crime Commissioner has identified this as a priority and the YOS has been working collaborative on a Pan Hampshire basis to support 'whole system approaches' to tackling this issues, as well as understanding the underlying causes
* Work with schools and education providers to ensure children who are at risk of offending have access to appropriate and high quality education provision- as note the continued identification of the risks posed by children on part time timetables has resulted in scrutiny of this cohort locally. The development of Family Engagement Workers, with a remit to work with children at risk of exclusion in order to maximise their access to provision has been a positive development, alongside improved integrated working with Police and other community partners to improve our offer - this includes support schools to connect with the rich offer of support provided by the community sector, including 'Fearless, Street Doctors and Soco Music Project'.
* Continue to develop a co-ordinated approach with Education Welfare, Families Matter and schools to improve the attendance of children who offend the Targeted and Restorative Service was developed to enhance capacity for more co-ordinated intervention. The next stage of the service is to develop and embed a more robust, integrated vulnerable adolescent offer for this cohort, ensuring that there are firm foundations for children known to be most at risk, where the complexity of their needs and home circumstances prohibit their engagement with mainstream provision.
* Continue to implement the recommendations of the Health Needs of Young Offenders report to achieve the stated outcomes and new models of delivery, by encouraging partners to commit resource- engagement from Health Partners at Management Board has increased. Commissioning arrangements have been identified as a risk to service delivery, in lieu of the absence of a commissioned substance misuse worker within the YOS for the entirety of 2018/19. A need for a reviewed Health Needs Assessment has been identified and an intern has been hired to carry out this piece of work during the summer of 2019.
* Continue to participate in the Youth Justice Board's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) project with partners to develop best practice for working with children with SEND- the YOS has built on its achievement of its "Action for All" Best Practice Quality Mark recognition and facilitated service user for feedback for SEND colleagues in the development of their  Inclusion Charter and strategy
* Develop and enhance Quality Assurance and Audit arrangements within the team by the introduction of peer auditing and referencing activity to wider stakeholder planning (i.e. EHCPs, Early Help Assessments etc.)- capacity has restricted the implementation of the volume of QA activity in place; though 2018/19 saw a Mock Inspection by colleagues from Portsmouth YOT and the commencement of external audit activity by independent consultants which will form the basis of the QA framework for 2019/20
* Develop Workforce Development offer to enable high quality Assessment, Planning, Intervention and Supervision-Bespoke Workforce Development Plan created. Review of this offer and broader Childrens and Families offer by external, independent consultants will form basis of 2019/20 review
* Evaluate reasons for disproportionate representation of children with mixed heritage background in  offending cohort and develop appropriate means of reducing this inequity- Disproportionality continues to be a concern and 2018/19 data indicates that black children are now disproportionality represented as well as mixed heritage children. The SYOS Manager has led on a larger piece of work to review disproportionality in the Criminal Justice system as a whole but the factors impacting upon disproportionality will be a further strategic objective for services delivering youth justice services in 2019/20    
Reducing First Time Entrants to the Youth Justice System
* Review the Southampton Joint Decision Making Panel following feedback from August 2017 HMIP Thematic Inspection to ensure that youth diversion arrangements continue to be robust.- Service delivery now incorporates a 'voice of the child' process before deciding on an appropriate intervention for some children committing serious offences. Street delivered Youth Community Resolutions are also more robustly screened at panel. However, pre intervention assessment remains a weakness across the whole of the 4 Hampshire based YOTs and this and other issues of concern will be addressed by a joint YOT/Constabulary Improvement Plan currently in development  
* Contribute to the Southampton Gateway Project, to extend the benefits of diversion and out of court disposals for young adults (18 to 24)-the project did not achieve the volume of referrals anticipated and subsequently, the Targeted and Restorative Service Family Engagement Workers involved in delivering interventions will have capacity to work more proactively with transition cases which come out of the Joint Decision Making Panel from May 2019   
* Work collaboratively with Pathways, Looked after Children's Team and Virtual School Head to improve offending and re-offending outcomes for Looked After Children in Southampton.- offending by Looked after children continues to be below the national average. The focus of intervention is now further 'upstream' and children who are at risk of exploitation and/or open to CiN or CP Planning are now a priority. Concerns about the length of time for some children to move through the Youth Justice system may potentially skew some data and this is being reviewed by YJB, police, HMCTS and YOT separately    
* Contribute to the city's ambition to become a Restorative City by further developing restorative practice in schools and with other partners; in order to provide innovative, outcome focussed opportunities for children- the YOS continues to support the 20 schools involved in the Restorative Practice Schools Network. The scope of the city's ambitions has extended and the YOS has been delivering Restorative Practice training to staff within the Local Authority as part of the ambition to become a Child Friendly City.
* Sell high quality training, rooted in areas of Youth Offending Service expertise; particularly Restorative Practice. - A training offer has been developed and rolled out to Local Authority colleagues, but this greatly reduces capacity to trade services, with so much focus on internal training and delivery. The service will look to develop capacity in 2019/20 to deliver to external organisations.
* Extend the reach of our arts project and restorative practice offer to benefit more young people and to develop Southampton YOS as a national exemplar of good practice. - The YOS continues to work closely with the local Pupil Referral Unit and is working with our Cultural Partners to develop offers to vulnerable children. The Virtual School have now identified the offer as a good practice 'external provision' offer that can be used by Social Worker s if appropriate and are now promoting it as such. 
* Evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and work undertaken to identify "at risk" children as early as possible presenting with complex needs who are not worked with by statutory services-plans have been developed in the last 12 months and arrangements have been developed by the Targeted and Restorative Service manager and police counterparts to develop more appropriate forums to identify children at risk and develop planning; a common misunderstanding has been an expectation that the YOS work with all children who have engaged in some level of offending, which is unlikely to be the case unless and until a child has been formerly charged.   The absence of a separate and distinct 'prevention' offer such as Hampshire's Youth Crime Prevention team, will need to be considered by Southampton's strategic partners.

Reducing Re-Offending
* Ensure that resources are targeted at the most prolific children who offend and those at risk of involvement in serious youth crime by reviewing the Priority Young People strategy with partners.-Engagement from partners was sporadic and non-attendance at meetings impacted upon the effectiveness of integrated planning. As a consequence the Priority Young Person Strategy was re-modelled to streamline planning and intervention by making use of forums already in place and to revise the definition of children in cohort subject to the strategy, particularly in light of increased concern about young people's exposure to knife crime and Child Criminal Exploitation. Concerns remained about the effectiveness of the strategy and as a consequence the Targeted and Restorative Service service manager and Hampshire Constabulary colleagues are developing a new forum to develop planning for children of concern. Pending implementation the Priority Young Person Strategy remains in place 
* Specific focussed management support with practitioners to deliver high quality, integrated intervention planning and co-ordinated step down planning when children exit the service- the development of the Targeted and Restorative service in 2018/19 and the return from maternity leave of one of the YOS ATMs has had a positive impact upon management support. Quality Audits have indicated the need to strengthen monitoring arrangements further.
* Develop the case formulation approach to manage the risks and needs of those young people at most risk of re-offending. - The Case Formulation model continues to provide a psychological focus on the risks of a small number of children open to the YOS. The challenge noted last year was how to link in best practice approaches using other models of assessment such as Restorative Supervision and High Risk Panels and ensure these are streamlined in order to prevent unnecessary duplication of work. The findings and feedback from the external auditors who have been reviewing the YOS will determine the direction of travel for future YOS practice.  Staff are being encouraged to use more child friendly language in the body of their assessments, rather than relying on professionally exclusive language, reminding staff that these are first and foremost the child's records.
* Deliver action plan to improve offending and re-offending outcomes for Looked after Children in Southampton. - As noted earlier; the rate of CLA offending has fallen and is no longer a concern. Focus of intervention is now on children further 'upstream' and upon efforts to ensure Looked after Children are still dealt with in an expeditious fashion by the Youth Justice System; this latter action requires close monitoring in 2019/20. Ongoing QA review of integrated planning between LAC/Pathways and YOS teams will also be prudent in lieu of external audit activity feedback to the authority.
* Development of an effective strategy to tackle  Children at risk of Criminal Exploitation; the YOS contributed to the Local Authority's revised exploitation Protocol and are a key member of the 4LSCB Child Exploitation Strategy Group. The authority is looking to develop a Vulnerable Adolescent offer; the YOS will be part of this service, to better support integrated working.  An exercise to identify YOS, education, CSE Met and Police concerns about the top ten most at risk provided fruitful and has led to improvements in information exchange, still being worked through. YJB funding has been acquired to try and develop our understanding of children at risk and joint planning with police will be undertaken in 2019/20. However, the level of integrated planning between services has been identified as a risk factor by external auditors and a review of local strategic oversight will be needed to ensure the above noted activity results in coherent and positive outcomes.

 Reducing Custody
* Continue to work with the West Hampshire Youth Bench to identify and implement alternative approaches to youth custody via deferred sentence strategy. - The YOS continue to propose deferred sentences if appropriate- though the increase in seriousness of offending has impacted upon number of sentencing events where this is a viable option. Custody rates did decrease significantly during 2018/19 indicating that custody was only imposed where absolutely necessary. 
* Participate in the South East Region Resettlement Forum to improve outcomes for young people leaving custody. - Attendance has been maintained throughout the last 12 months and the introduction of the YJAF portal has increased capacity to share and exchange information more effectively with the secure estate. Concerns about the secure estate- primarily HMYOI Feltham- continue and the impact of these concerns on outcomes for children is monitored.
* Review and implement local Weapons Awareness Strategy - the strategy produced some success during 2018/19; particularly the development of the Police Apprentice Strategy in schools with Hampshire Constabulary. Knife related concerns continued to be a concern in Southampton though and the focus of the strategy has been recalibrated with focus going forward in to 2019/20 upon action rather than awareness. This will be reflected by a new monthly action group discussing the most concerning individuals at risk of perpetrating or being victim of weapons related crime.   This work will now cascade upwards to support local delivery of Violence Reduction Unit in close collaboration with Police, Health and Education partners.

Response to Risks and Emerging Themes in the last 12 months
There are a number of means by which progress has been measured in the last 12 months leading to the identification of emerging risks and actions to address them;
* The YOS management team regularly interrogate data from the Reducing Re-Offending Live Time Tracker in order to gauge real time trends and identify cohorts or children of concern. Over the last 12 months attention has been given to children who reoffend within the first month of committing an index offence. Live time tracking data indicates these children go on to become the most prolific re-offenders in the cohort. Attempts to address this issue have been hampered by concerns about the time taken from offence to charge; nationally the time from offence to charge has increased by 28.4%. This impacts upon the speed and efficacy of response and a joined up approach between SYOS, HMCTS and Hampshire Constabulary is key to addressing this and a strategy will need to be developed in the coming 12 months
* National and local data continues to be analysed on a quarterly basis and over the last 12 months there have been continuing concerns that ETE data indicates significant numbers of children are not completing their interventions with positive outcomes. For children under 16 this links in with concerns about the link between offending behaviour and children who are on part time timetables, permanently excluded or persistently absent. For children over 16 are not accessing the ETE offers locally. Colleagues in Education are requested to update the Youth Justice Management Board quarterly with details of progress in tackling these issues. 
* The YOS are invited to and engage in a number of local and regional forums where exploitation trends and risks are reviewed. Locally our involvement in Safer City Meetings, 4LSCB Exploitation Meetings, Missing, Exploited and Trafficked (MET) meetings and development of a Weapons Action Strategy have highlighted risks associated with this area. The YOS was part of a successful bid for funding from the YJB to identify more effective ways of monitoring children at risk of Serious Youth Violence who may be involved in exploitative behaviour. This piece of work will be rolled out with police colleagues in 2019
* Serious Youth Violence is itself a concern due to the disproportionate impact the seriousness of offending has upon resources. Locally a small cohort of children have undertaken a hugely disproportionate amount of crime and the extremity of their violence has led to regular reviews of risk and vulnerability. The YOS has worked with the police in an attempt to recalibrate its approach to Serious Youth Violence and a new draft Serious Youth Violence Strategy is in place  
* Whilst not a new and emerging theme, recognition of the need for Trauma Informed Practice has played a central part in planning and workforce development in the past 12 months. The Targeted and Restorative Service has supported an approach co-ordinated by the Police and Crime Commissioner to develop trusted adult workers to work with children, many of whom who are open to or at risk of being open to, the YOS. This trauma informed approach is being led by the Targeted and Restorative Service. 
* There is no longer a need to inform the YJB of Critical Safeguarding and Public Protection Incidents. As a consequence a new Internal Learning Review process has been developed. One offence fitted the criteria of this process; a young person who murdered his baby. In lieu of a wider multi-agency review of this case, no internal review has been completed
* The Reducing Re-Offending Action Plan was previously reviewed on a quarterly basis but following feedback from the service's Mock Inspection in October 2018 that the service had too many action plans running a decision was made to incorporate actions into a single Operational Improvement Plan developed after self-evaluation against the new HMIP Inspection framework.
* National Standards were reviewed during 2018 and launched in the new 2019/20 financial year. The reduction in the prescriptive requirements of the standards and the renewed focus on strategic oversight of the YOT Management Board are a focus of these standards and a benchmarking exercise will be taking place in coming months
As a consequence of the emerging themes noted and progress against the original 2017-20 actions, a number of additional actions have been identified which will need to be incorporated into the action plan (Appendix 2) to address the following service priorities;
Reducing Youth Crime
* Fully implement the Operational Action Plan developed following recommendations of external audit of the service
* Undertake benchmarking exercise to evaluate the implementation of the new National Standards and continue to develop strategic overview and understanding of this implementation by Youth Justice Management Board
Reducing First Time Entrants
* Develop a local, pan agency Diversion Strategy in line with the guidance in new National Standards
Reducing Re-Offending
* In lieu of decreasing overall re-offending rates, the YOS will utilise the YJB Funded Serious Youth Violence grant to develop a greater understanding of children undertaking serious offences and develop more appropriate, trauma based interventions to prevent re-offending by this cohort.
        Reducing Custody Rates
* Full engagement and participation locally with Safer City Partnership review of Serious Violence Strategy and contribute to the development of the local Violent Reduction Units
The Partnership's Response to Inspection Reports Published in the last 12 months 

There have been no Thematic Inspections published in the last 12 months for the SYOS      to review. However, our neighbours in Hampshire were subject to an Inspection and some of the recommendations are relevant to Southampton.
* ensure YOS planning takes account of and is aligned with other agencies' planning e.g. Children in Need plans
* develop guidance for staff on how to complete plans incorporating risk of harm to others and safety and well-being, while maintaining the quality of their child-friendly young people's plans
* develop suitable indirect reparation placements, to be delivered through a restorative approach, when no direct restorative intervention is available
All three recommendations resonate with practice deficit issues highlighted in 2018's SYOS/PYOT Mock Inspection and feedback from the external audit activity. Action plans have been developed to address and will form the basis of some of the actions going forward for the SYOS in 2019/20



Section 2: Contribution to Partner Strategies and Priorities
Partnership working is at the heart of the success of the Youth Justice System in Southampton. The below diagram summarises the priorities laid out within this plan for the next three years and identifies the interdependence of these priorities with those of partners involved in the service delivery of a) interventions to safeguard and protect the young people of the city who are open to the Youth Offending Service and b) interventions directed to protect people within the broader population who may be at risk from offending behaviour. All of this is delivered within the context of the ambition to become Child Friendly Southampton





       	





	

	





	








Section 3: Service User Perspectives
During the last 12 months Children and Young People's views have been sought via a number of different forums:
* Half Termly "Have Your Say" meetings with the YOS Manager which result in discussion within team regarding changes to service delivery (ie comments about building have been raised at strategic level within the authority
* Access to paper feedback forms which, if filled in are then discussed with relevant case manager
* Participation in the wider SCC response to the national "Make Your Mark" Youth Parliament. Over 13,000 children participated in the city and 50% of the YOS cohort at time of the exercise participated. Knife Crime, Mental Health and Equal Pay were  identified as priorities for children in the city
* As a result of the feedback, children open to YOS participated in a round table discussion with the SCC Young Person's Engagement Officer about how the authority can make the streets safer for children
* Children and victim's views were included in the 2018/19 Operational Action Plan
* Children open to YOS participated in a piece of work with SEND Colleagues to find out what children think is inclusion, exclusion and segregation; whether they think that inclusion is a good thing; what makes you feel included; what do schools / adults do that makes you feel included; all as part of the development of a SEND Charter
* Children have sat on recruitment panels to assist the YOS when appointing staff to the team
As part of the process for this Strategy review children were invited to meet with myself and with members of the Police and Crime Commissioner's Youth Commission to feedback their views on priorities. The Youth Commission will feedback to the Commissioner with a view to him considering their feedback for his youth priorities in 2019/20. For the purposes of the SYOS Youth Justice Strategy, the children identified the following areas of concern- all of which reflect priorities identified in this document:
* Youth Violence- whilst children interviewed did not feel unsafe they noted that violence had become normalised
* ETE provision- the local offer is not considered to be suitable for needs. The offer is what is felt is required by services; not what the Children want
* SYOS Service Provision- not enough groups or Motivational Interviews. The SYOS will need to develop types of intervention it offers

Section 4: Risks to Future Delivery
Detailed information about emerging concerns about performance and plans to sustain good practice were referenced in Section 1. Data highlighting performance is included in Appendix 3 and 4 and details of how these risks will be tackled is incorporated into a revised 2017-20 Service Priorities Table, to be implemented in next 12 months, in Appendix 2  
Specific details about emerging and continuing concerns about improvements against First Time Entrants and Custody measures can also be found in more detail in these sections; including the actions planned to reduce these risks.
All of these areas of future delivery will be impacted upon factors identified by the risk matrix noted in Appendix 8



Section 5: Structure and Governance 
The Youth Offending Service is a statutory service, positioned within the People's Directorate of Southampton City Council. The service is based within the Targeted and Restorative Service which itself is situated within the Integrated and Specialist Service; See appendix 5
The YOS is multi-disciplinary with each statutory partner contributing staff and/or money. Currently there are 12 full time posts and 7 part time posts as per last year, though the service has had significant vacancies during the last 12 months. This resourcing compares with 14 full time posts and 8 part time posts in 2017and 18 full time and 8 part time posts identified in 2014. This is a risk noted in the Risk Matrix in Appendix 8 
Staff are employed directly by the local authority or seconded from agencies such as NPS, Hampshire Constabulary and CAMHS. In addition, aligned to the YOS, though not working specifically with young people open to the service are an Assistant Team Manager and 6 Family Engagement Workers as part of the Targeted and Integrated Service
Southampton Youth Offending Service management board is chaired by the Service Lead for Integrated and Specialist Services. Senior officers of Southampton City Council Children and Families Directorate, Southampton CCG, Hampshire Constabulary and NPS are invited as statutory partners. The Lead Council Member, Youth Justice Board and representatives from other agencies involved in facilitating the delivery of youth justice services such as the Courts, Public Health and the Integrated Commissioning Unit are also invited. The Local Authority's Participation Officer is invited in order to ensure the voice of the Child is heard. The joint working agreement to support effective governance was reviewed in February 2018 and contain details of how the partnership is expected to hold each other to account, monitor performance and support the YOS. The management board is linked to the relevant local authorities including Children's Trust arrangements, Local Safeguarding Children's Board, Local Criminal Justice Board and Safe City Partnership. 
The board provides strategic direction and support to the YOS manager; ensuring that planning is undertaken to reduce re-offending safeguard children and young people. Meetings are convened on a quarterly basis. Further sub-groups of the management board may be set up from time to time if required. The Management Board oversees and contributes towards the Youth Offending Service's statutory aims. It fulfils the requirements of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and YJB guidance by ensuring that Southampton Youth Offending Service has sufficient resources and infrastructure to deliver youth justice services in its area in line with the requirements of the National Standards for Youth Justice Services. 
The management board also ensures that relevant staff are seconded to the Youth Offending Service in line with the requirements of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and that the Youth Offending Service has sufficient access to mainstream services provided by partners and other key agencies. In exceptional circumstances, where consideration is being given to deviating from a particular National Standard; the board will inform the relevant YJB Head of Business Area of the decision, rationale and the action plan and timelines to reinstate compliance. The board would monitor the action plan on a regular basis and progress reported to the YJB Head of Region or Head of YJB for Wales and YJB Head of Performance on a regular basis. 
The Board agrees the funding arrangement and ensure that arrangements are in place for a pooled budget. It ensures that information is exchanged between partner agencies in line with relevant legislation and in particular the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Finally, the board receives quarterly performance reports and works with the Youth Offending Service Manager to improve and sustain performance and quality standards. It also considers reviews of serious incidents (as defined by the YJB- though no longer a mandatory piece of work).



Section 6: Resources and Value for Money
The estimated budget and expenditure for 2019/20 (excluding payment in kind costs such as seconded staff) is noted below
ContributionsEstimated Expenditure££SCC531,252Staffing520,900OPCC55,700Overheads237,500Probation5,000Activity Costs 99,700Health19,000Accommodation 14,800Youth Justice Grant (inc JAC)214,234Total Estimated Expenditure872,900Estimated contributions for 2018/19825,186Estimated Variance47,714 overspend
There is a predicted overspend which at the time of writing this strategy, the SYOS Youth Justice Management Board have been tasked with resolving. This overspend is therefore a significant risk to service delivery. 
Youth Justice Grant funding is reliant on this document providing details of how the YOS proposes to use the above noted funding to fulfil the purposes of this grant. Details of this can be found in Appendix 6.   
Details of the programme delivered within the Junior Attendance Centre can be found in Appendix 7 



Section 7: Plan Approval & Sign-off

We confirm that the Youth Justice Management Board has approved the Youth Justice Plan Review for 2019-20.

Appendix 1 Southampton YOS Vision, Purpose and Principles

Vision
Southampton Youth Offending Service is committed to contributing to a fair and effective Criminal Justice System which will provide justice for victims and local communities, rehabilitation, punishment and positive opportunities for children and value for money. We are a service that aspires to provide the best for our children and young people: we want them to achieve and succeed and we recognise that they will need robust support and supervision along the way in order to do this.
As the service develops we aspire to ensure that children's needs are understood and supported in the context of their 'whole family' and that we apply a strengths based and restorative approach to our direct work with families. To this end, we envisage the Youth Offending Service to be at the forefront of developing the city's ambitions as a Restorative City 
Purpose
Our purpose is to prevent young people offending and once in the Criminal Justice System to accurately assess and offer high quality interventions to young people to reduce crime and to protect victims, in order to increase public safety in Southampton.
We will do this by:
* preventing offending
* reducing re-offending
* improving outcomes for young people
* protecting the public from the harm that young people can cause to individuals, communities and the public and
* working to ensure custody is limited only for those young people whose risk cannot be managed in the community
* promoting restorative practices in a range of settings to minimise and mitigate the risk of harm that can be caused by problematic and risk taking behaviour
* innovating and developing exemplars of good practice to share with a wider professional network and introducing a learning culture to our workforce
* working with the whole family; no child's needs should be assessed in isolation
Principles
The principles underpinning our service are: 

* Regard for the safety of the public as a priority 
* Provision of a fair and equitable service to children who offend, staff, victims and the wider public 
* Respect for children who offend as children first and foremost 
* Respect for diversity in terms of race, gender, disability, age and sexual orientation 
* Promotion of the rights of victims and the rights and responsibilities of children and their families 
* Valuing staff as our most important resource 
* A collaborative partnership approach, based on effective analysis of local data

Appendix 2: Service Priorities Update 
 
What are we going to do in the next 12 months?PrioritiesKey ActionsLead AgencyLead PartnersHow we will measure success between now and 2020?Reduce youth crimeWork with partners to respond to recommendations arising from the 2016 National Review of Youth Justice to improve education and economic outcomes.Youth Offending Service Management BoardSouthampton City Council/National Probation Service/ Hampshire Constabulary/  Southampton Clinical Commissioning GroupYouth Justice Strategic Plan integrates with  partner strategies and arrangements to offer a coherent and robust response to the national review of youth justice and subsequent direction of travel for the Youth Justice System

Progress to date: 
The YOS and the YOS Management Board have moved beyond the initial focus on the recommendations from this review but we continue to monitor developments at local and national level and incorporate these into the development of local strategies to tackle education and economic outcomes. A focus on the links between part time timetables/exclusions/absence and risks to children of exploitation and/or offending behaviour is now a key driver in this area. The Police and Crime Commissioner has identified this as a priority and the YOS has been working collaborative on a Pan Hampshire basis to support 'whole system approaches' to tackling this issues, as well as understanding the underlying causesWork with schools and education providers to ensure children who are at risk of offending have access to appropriate and high quality education provision.Youth Offending ServiceTargeted and Restorative Service/ Skills and Development/SchoolsImproved educational attainment at key stages for young people who offend

Progress to Date: 
The continued identification of the risks posed by children on part time timetables has resulted in scrutiny of this cohort locally. The development of Family Engagement Workers, with a remit to work with children at risk of exclusion in order to maximise their access to provision has been a positive development, alongside improved integrated working with Police and other community partners to improve our offer - this includes support schools to connect with the rich offer of support provided by the community sector, including 'Fearless, Street Doctors and Soco Music Project'.Continue to develop a co-ordinated approach with Education Welfare, Families Matter and schools to improve the attendance of children who offend. Youth Offending Service Management BoardTargeted and Restorative Service/ Skills and Development/Schools /John Hansard Gallery/ Wheatsheaf TrustGaining Platinum 'Artsmark' standard for our arts provision. 

Increase education, training and employment engagement by 10% for young people who offend.

Progress to Date: 
The Targeted and Restorative Service was developed to enhance capacity for more co-ordinated intervention. The next stage of the service is to develop and embed a more robust, integrated vulnerable adolescent offer for this cohort, ensuring that there are firm foundations for children known to be most at risk, where the complexity of their needs and home circumstances prohibit their engagement with mainstream provision.
Continue to implement the recommendations of the Health Needs of Young Offenders report to achieve the stated outcomes and new models of delivery, by encouraging partners to commit resource.Youth Offending Service Management BoardSouthampton Clinical Commissioning Group/ Solent Health Trust/  Education and Early Years' ServiceIncrease the % of young people who are accessing health support appropriate to their needs.

Progress to Date: 
Engagement from Health Partners at Management Board has increased. Commissioning arrangements have been identified as a risk to service delivery, in lieu of the absence of a commissioned substance misuse worker within the YOS for the entirety of 2018/19. A need for a reviewed Health Needs Assessment has been identified and an intern has been hired to carry out this piece of work during the summer of 2019Continue to participate in the Youth Justice Board's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) project with partners to develop best practice for working with children with SEND.Youth Offending ServiceYouth Offending Service / Education Service / SchoolsImprovements in service delivery for young people who offend with SEND 

Progress to Date: 
The YOS has built on its achievement of its "Action for All" Best Practice Quality Mark recognition and facilitated service user for feedback for SEND colleagues in the development of their  Inclusion Charter and strategyDevelop and enhance Quality Assurance and Audit arrangements within the team by the introduction of peer auditing and referencing activity to wider stakeholder planning (i.e. EHCPs, Early Help Assessments etc.)Youth Offending Service/SCC Quality Assurance Service ManagerYouth Offending Service/SCC Quality Assurance Service ManagerIncreased number of audits indicating work is of an excellent standard across a range of different auditing activities

Progress to Date: 
Capacity has restricted the implementation of the volume of QA activity in place; though 2018/19 saw a Mock Inspection by colleagues from Portsmouth YOT and the commencement of external audit activity by independent consultants which will form the basis of the QA framework for 2019/20 Develop Workforce Development offer to enable high quality  Assessment, Planning, Intervention and SupervisionYouth Offending Service/SCC Learning and Development/SCC Quality Assurance Service ManagerYouth Offending Service/ SCC Learning and Development/SCC Quality Assurance Service ManagerIncreased number of audits indicating work is of an excellent standard across a range of different auditing activities

Progress to Date
Workforce Development Plan created. Review of this offer and broader Childrens and Families offer by external, independent consultants will form basis of 2019/20 reviewEvaluate reasons for disproportionate representation of children with mixed heritage background in  offending cohort and develop appropriate means of reducing this inequityYouth Offending Service, Youth Offending Service Management Board, 0-19 Early Help ServicesYouth Offending Service and identified partners where appropriateDecrease in mixed heritage (and other BAME groups) disproportionality in offending figures

Progress to Date
Disproportionality continues to be a concern and 2018/19 indicated that black children are now disproportionality represented as well as mixed heritage children. The SYOS Manager has led on a larger piece of work to review disproportionality in the Criminal Justice system as a whole but the factors impacting upon disproportionality will be a further strategic objective for services delivering youth justice services in 2019/20Reduce first time entrants to the youth justice systemReview the Southampton Joint Decision Making Panel following feedback from August 2017 HMIP Thematic Inspection to ensure that youth diversion arrangements continue to be robust.Youth Offending ServiceHampshire Constabulary/NHS Liaison and Diversion Service/ Targeted and Restorative ServiceReduction in first time entrants to Youth Justice System.

Progress to date: 
Service delivery now incorporates a 'voice of the child' process before deciding on an appropriate intervention for some children committing serious offences. Street delivered Youth Community Resolutions are also more robustly screened at panel. However, pre intervention assessment remains a weakness across the whole of the 4 Hampshire based YOTs and this and other issues of concern will be addressed by a joint YOT/Constabulary Improvement Plan currently in development  Contribute to the Southampton Gateway Project, to extend the benefits of diversion and out of court disposals for young adults (18 to 24).Hampshire Constabulary/Hampshire Constabulary/Targeted and Restorative Service Reduced offending/re-offending rates of young people aged 18 to 24 year olds who have benefited from an out of court disposal.

Progress to Date: 
the project did not achieve the volume of referrals anticipated and subsequently, the Targeted and Restorative Service Family Engagement Workers involved in delivering interventions will have capacity to work more proactively with transition cases which come out of the Joint Decision Making Panel from May 2019 Work collaboratively with Pathways, Looked After Children's Team and Virtual School Head to improve offending and re-offending outcomes for Looked After Children in Southampton. Youth Offending Service/Children's Social CareYouth Offending Service/Children's Social CareReduce the number of Looked After Children entering the criminal justice system.

Progress to Date
Offending by Looked after children continues to be below the national average. The focus of intervention is now further 'upstream' and children who are at risk of exploitation and/or open to CiN or CP Planning are now a priority. Concerns about the length of time for some children to move through the Youth Justice system may potentially skew some data and this is being reviewed by YJB, police, HMCTS and YOT separately    Contribute to the city's ambition to become a Restorative City by further developing restorative practice in schools and with other partners; in order to provide innovative, outcome focussed opportunities for children. Education  service/ Targeted and Restorative ServiceTargeted and Restorative Service/ SchoolsIncrease the number of schools working with Youth Offending Service.

Decrease the number of young people who feel bullying is a major issue for the city. 

Progress to Date
The YOS continues to support the 20 schools involved in the Restorative Practice Schools Network. The scope of the city's ambitions has extended and the YOS has been delivering Restorative Practice training to staff within the Local Authority as part of the ambition to become a Child Friendly CitySell high quality training, rooted in areas of Youth Offending Service expertise; particularly Restorative Practice.Education and early years' serviceYouth Offending ServiceGenerate income to support the sustainability and growth of local youth justice provision

Progress to Date: 
A training offer has been developed and rolled out to Local Authority colleagues, but this greatly reduces capacity to trade services, with so much focus on internal training and delivery. The service will look to develop capacity in 2019/20 to deliver to external organisations.Extend the reach of our arts project and restorative practice offer to benefit more young people and to develop Southampton YOS as a national exemplar of good practice.Youth Offending ServiceJohn Hansard Gallery/Restorative Practice CouncilGaining Platinum 'Artsmark' standard for our arts provision. 

Utilisation of Gold Restorative Justice Council Accreditation (Training Providers Quality Mark).

Progress to Date: 
The YOS continues to work closely with the local Pupil Referral Unit and is working with our Cultural Partners to develop offers to vulnerable children. The Virtual School have now identified the offer as a good practice 'external provision' offer that can be used by Social Worker s if appropriate and are now promoting it as such.Evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and work undertaken to identify "at risk" children as early as possible presenting with complex needs who are not worked with by statutory services Targeted and Restorative ServiceTargeted and Restorative ServiceReduction in First Time Entrants; including young people presenting with complex needs and/or committing serious offences

Progress to Date
Plans have been developed in the last 12 months and arrangements have been developed by the Targeted and Restorative Service manager and police counterparts to develop more appropriate forums to identify children at risk and develop planning; a common misunderstanding has been an expectation that the YOS work with all children who have engaged in some level of offending, which is unlikely to be the case unless and until a child has been formerly charged.   The absence of a separate and distinct 'prevention' offer such as Hampshire's Youth Crime Prevention team, will need to be considered by Southampton's strategic partners.Reduce custodyContinue to work with the West Hampshire Youth Bench to identify and implement alternative approaches to youth custody via deferred sentence strategy.Youth Offending Service Management BoardWest Hampshire Youth BenchReduce custody rates by 20%.

Progress to Date: 
The YOS continue to propose deferred sentences if appropriate- though the increase in seriousness of offending has impacted upon number of sentencing events where this is a viable option. Custody rates did decrease significantly during 2018/19 indicating that custody was only imposed where absolutely necessary.Participate in the South East Region Resettlement Forum to improve outcomes for young people leaving custody.Youth Offending ServiceNo Limits Next StepsNext Steps support is offered to all relevant custody leavers who are eligible for entry onto the programme

Progress to Date: 
Attendance has been maintained throughout the last 12 months and the introduction of the YJAF portal has increased capacity to share and exchange information more effectively with the secure estate. Concerns about the secure estate- primarily HMYOI Feltham- continue and the impact of these concerns on outcomes for children is monitoredReview and implement local Weapons Awareness StrategyHampshire Constabulary/Public Health/Targeted and Restorative Service/Education ServiceHampshire Constabulary/Public Health/Targeted and Restorative Service/Education ServiceReduction in offences involving a weapon

Reduce Custody rates by 20%

Progress to Date
The strategy produced some success during 2018/19; particularly the development of the Police Apprentice Strategy in schools with Hampshire Constabulary. Knife related concerns continued to be a concern in Southampton though and the focus of the strategy has been recalibrated with focus going forward in to 2019/20 upon action rather than awareness. This will be reflected by a new monthly action group discussing the most concerning individuals at risk of perpetrating or being victim of weapons related crime.   This work will now cascade upwards to support local delivery of Violence Reduction Unit in close collaboration with Police, Health and Education partners.Reduce reoffending Ensure that resources are targeted at the most prolific young offenders and those at risk of involvement in serious youth crime by reviewing the Priority Young People strategy with partners.Youth Offending Service Management BoardHampshire Constabulary/ Community Safety TeamMaintain a low re-offending rate.
Decrease in serious youth crime and drug distribution. Decrease in violent re-offending

Progress to Date; 
Engagement from partners was sporadic and non-attendance at meetings impacted upon the effectiveness of integrated planning. As a consequence the Priority Young Person Strategy was re-modelled to streamline planning and intervention by making use of forums already in place and to revise the definition of children in cohort subject to the strategy, particularly in light of increased concern about young people's exposure to knife crime and Child Criminal Exploitation. Concerns remained about the effectiveness of the strategy and as a consequence the Targeted and Restorative Service service manager and Hampshire Constabulary colleagues are developing a new forum to develop planning for children of concern. Pending implementation the Priority Young Person Strategy remains in placeSpecific focussed management support with practitioners to deliver high quality, integrated intervention planning and co-ordinated step down planning when children exit the serviceYouth Offending ServiceYouth Offending ServiceAll plans quality assured by management team achieve rating of 'good'

Progress to Date: 
The development of the Targeted and Restorative service in 2018/19 and the return from maternity leave of one of the YOS ATMs has had a positive impact upon management support. Quality Audits have indicated the need to strengthen monitoring arrangements furtherDevelop the case formulation approach to manage the risks and needs of those young people at most risk of re-offending.Youth Offending Service Southampton Children and Adolescent Mental Health ServiceAll Priority Young People will be subject to a case formulation approach.

Progress to Date: 
The Case Formulation model continues to provide a psychological focus on the risks of a small number of children open to the YOS. The challenge noted last year was how to link in best practice approaches using other models of assessment such as Restorative Supervision and High Risk Panels and ensure these are streamlined in order to prevent unnecessary duplication of work. The findings and feedback from the external auditors who have been reviewing the YOS will determine the direction of travel for future YOS practice.  Staff are being encouraged to use more child friendly language in the body of their assessments, rather than relying on professionally exclusive language, reminding staff that these are first and foremost the child's records.Deliver action plan to improve offending and re-offending outcomes for Looked After Children in Southampton. Youth Offending Service Management BoardHampshire Constabulary/ Children and Families ServiceIncrease the use of restorative interventions with Looked After Children.

Progress to Date 
As noted earlier; the rate of CLA offending has fallen and is no longer a concern. Focus of intervention is now on children further 'upstream' and upon efforts to ensure Looked after Children are still dealt with in an expeditious fashion by the Youth Justice System; this latter action requires close monitoring in 2019/20. Ongoing QA review of integrated planning between LAC/Pathways and YOS teams will also be prudent in lieu of external audit activity feedback to the authority.
Development of an effective strategy to tackle  Children at risk of Criminal ExploitationChildrens and Families Service/Youth Offending Service/Hampshire ConstabularyChildrens and Families Service/Youth Offending Service/Hampshire ConstabularyReduction in young people identified as a risk of CCE

Progress to date
The YOS contributed to the Local Authority's revised exploitation Protocol and are a key member of the 4LSCB Child Exploitation Strategy Group. The authority is looking to develop a Vulnerable Adolescent offer; the YOS will be part of this service, to better support integrated working.  An exercise to identify YOS, education, CSE Met and Police concerns about the top ten most at risk provided fruitful and has led to improvements in information exchange, still being worked through. YJB funding has been acquired to try and develop our understanding of children at risk and joint planning with police will be undertaken in 2019/20. However, the level of integrated planning between services has been identified as a risk factor by external auditors and a review of local strategic oversight will be needed to ensure the above noted activity results in coherent and positive outcomes.

Appendix 3 - 2018-19 Performance 

Summary:

This section summarises service performance against national and local performance indicators during 2018/19. Data for the national performance indicators is from the most recent available period.

Performance against National Indicators:

Reducing Custody

               Green < 0.30    Amber < 0.50     Red > 0.50       (per 1000)

Measure
This indicator measures the number of custodial sentences given to young people per 1,000 young people (10 to 17 years) in the locality. It is drawn from Child View and uses population data taken from the Office of National Statistics midyear estimates.

Measure
New methodology
The Ministry of Justice has changed the methodology for measuring reoffending. There has been a move to a three month cohort rather than a 12 month cohort. The cohort will still be tracked over 12 months. Changing from 12 month cohorts to the 3 month cohorts results in a greater proportion of prolific offenders and hence higher reoffending rates, though both measures show similar trends over time at a national level (see below). There is a greater variance at local level so the My YOT page shows the Annual reoffending rate.

Measure
This indicator measures First Time Entrants (FTE) using data drawn from the Police National Computer - the graph displays the number of FTEs as a rate per 100,000 young people (10 to 17 years) locally. It uses population data taken from the Office of National Statistics midyear estimates.
The cohort represents young people who have received a first 'substantive outcome' in the period i.e. Reprimand, Final Warning or court outcome.

Appendix 4 - Re-offending Live Tracker Tool

The live re-offending tracker performance is measured on those young people identified as having an outcome date from April 2017 to March 2018 and then looking at any re-offending behaviour over the following year.
The total cohort for the year was 145 young people (119 male and 26 female).  The ethnicity breakdown for the whole cohort is 115 White, 12 Mixed, 5 Black, 6 Asian and 7 Unknown.  There are 7 of the cohort who were LAC at the time of their disposal.
For the period of 01/04/18 to 31/03/19, 46 of the cohort have re-offended during the 12 months after their initial disposal (43 male and 3 female).  The ethnicity of the re-offenders is 38 White, 3 Mixed, 4 Asian and 1 Black.  There are 3 of the re-offenders who were LAC at the time of their outcome.
The 46 young people that re-offended committed a total of 161 re-offences.  There were 13 of the young people that committed 5 or more re-offences.  These 13 young people accounted for 59.6% (96) of the total re-offences committed. The YOS will ensure efforts are made to monitor this group

The overall binary re-offending rate at 31/03/2019 is 31.72%.

Appendix 8 2019 Risk Register


SYOS Risk Register 2019
Risk DescriptionImpactRisk OwnerRating Action RequiredAction OwnerNational economic climate 

Austerity affecting all partners and their resilience to maintain delivery of services
Difficulty in maintaining existing levels of service delivery and having adaptability and capacity to tackle emerging trends and negative impact upon performance

Continual change
 
Ability to invest in technological advancement is reduced

YOS Management BoardHighReview of service delivery model during 2019-20





Forward plan review of annual budget setting exercise to fit in with quarterly Board meetings

Robust QA and monitoring to ensure standards and performance are not impacted by changing service delivery priorities

Agencies represented at the Board need to provide clarity on resource and structure of respective agencies for 2019/20 and potential impact for resourcing of the SYOS SCC

YOS Management BoardConflicting structural and operational frameworks 

National & local autonomySome partners are less able to operate innovatively and independently due to national constraints; impacting upon the ability of the Board to collectively deliver effective systems to maintain performance
YOS Management BoardMediumBoard members to follow up actions developed and endorsed at workshop held in July 2018 and External Audit Feedback of June 2019 to review Strategic engagement and decision making and evidence action taken to mitigate risks at quarterly Board. YOS Manager to oversee operational delivery

Changes to caseload and 
emerging threats and demands

Volume and nature of crime is changing



Change in profile of offending may require staff training and different/increased intervention provision to adequately cater for different needs. Emerging trends may therefore impact negatively upon performance as a consequence

Seriousness of FTE is a concern and both the profile of staff skill set and number of staff with professional qualifications (2.5 fit) does not currently reflect complexity of child now being supervised. 

 YOS Management BoardHighResources to continue to be directed into Prevention and Early Help Work

Bespoke workforce development planning to review training needs of staff

YOS to engage with Safer City Partnership and Strategy Unit to develop a response to Serious Violence strategy

YOS to engage with LSCB and Hampshire Constabulary to develop countywide, multi-agency approach to County Lines and Child Criminal Exploitation

New funding Streams have become available- EIYF, Troubled Families Knife Crime, RP Training. The YOS will link into these areas of work and within the parameters of ongoing Children and Families Service Review to identify effective ways of tackling the current offending profile of children worked with

Ongoing C&F Service Review will be basis for development of workforce planning to be reviewed in 2019/20 YJ Strategy. In addition to issues noted staffing resource and profile means there is currently a significant reduction in capacity to provide a) Robust Indirect Reparation as a RJ intervention as per updated Referral Order Guidance and b) pre intervention risk screening as per HMIP recommendations.

Resource needs to be identified to assist the YOS in meeting its obligations in relation to the above.  YOS Management Board
