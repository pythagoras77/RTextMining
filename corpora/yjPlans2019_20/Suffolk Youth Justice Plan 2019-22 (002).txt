
YOUTH JUSTICE PLAN 
2019 - 2022 
 
Foreword 
The Management Board continues to be very grateful for the skill and dedication of the Suffolk Youth Justice Service (SYJS) staff who work with children and young people who have offended or are at risk of offending in Suffolk.  
We know that SYJS is a good service, for example when surveyed, 100% of children and young people said that things had got better for them during the time they were involved with SYJS. 
This year as well as reporting on performance in 2018-19, the Youth Justice Plan covers the direction of travel for the next 3 years. It also renews our commitment in Suffolk to intervening early and diverting as many children and young people from the formal youth justice system as possible.  
The Board itself has attended two development events during 2018-19 including one which was attended by a range of staff and partners which gave the Board a real insight into the breadth and complexity of the work delivered by the service on behalf of Suffolk.  
Looking forward, the Board has been considering how best to introduce the new Youth Justice Board Standards for Children in the Youth Justice System and adapt them to fit into the local context. In 2019-20 a substantial piece of work to self-audit against these new standards with be undertaken.  
On behalf of the Management Board, I am pleased to present the Suffolk Youth Justice Plan for 2019-22

Introduction 
The Suffolk Youth Justice Service (SYJS) works with children and young people who are in, or on the edge of the Youth Justice System together with their parents or carers, and the victims of those offences as well as the wider community. As well as supervising young people sentenced by the courts, SYJS also delivers a Diversion programme offering early intervention and prevention services.  
The main purpose of this work is to reduce the number of children in the youth justice system; reduce the likelihood of re-offending by children or young people in the youth justice system; improve their safety and wellbeing; enhance their life aspirations and opportunities and improve their outcomes; whilst at the same time protecting the public from harm.  
This Youth Justice Plan reviews the performance outcomes and service delivery of Suffolk Youth Justice Service over the past 12 months and outlines the youth justice strategic priorities for the forthcoming 3 years.  It has been developed with the SYJS Management Board.  
 
Vision and Mission  
The Youth Justice Service in Suffolk contributes to the Suffolk County Councils Children and Young Peoples Services vision that: 
All children and families in Suffolk have the right to be safe, the best education, physical and emotional health, successful preparation for adulthood and employment. Too many children do not have these opportunities and we are committed to changing that. We must be brave and change the way we work to deliver this 
The Youth Justice Board has adopted a 'child first offender second' principle. In line with this principle Suffolk Youth Justice Service will:  
• Promote the best interests of each child or young person it works with.  
• Help them build on their strengths and capabilities, fulfil their potential and make a positive crime free contribution to society.  
• Collaborate with children, young people and parents and carers in all its work.   
• Put the views, needs and safety of actual and potential victims at the centre of everything it does.  
 
Diversion Programme 
SYJS believes in working with young people at risk of or involved in offending or anti-social behaviour at the earliest opportunity and seeks to maximise opportunities to divert young children and people from the formal criminal justice system in every appropriate case. The Diversion Programme is a joint countywide initiative delivered by SYJS and Suffolk Constabulary which works with young people who are at risk of offending or anti-social behaviour or are suitable for diversion from formal criminal justice processes. Young people who are at risk of Urban Street Gang or County Lines (USG&CL) involvement and young people who commit harmful sexual behaviour (HSB) are a priority group for this intervention. The Diversion Programme accept referrals, from schools, police and other partner agencies, as well as parents/carers and self-referrals.  
The Programme has been independently evaluated by the University of Suffolk and the Centre for Justice Innovation (2017). The evaluation evidenced a range of positive outcomes for young people and parent/carers and based on the cohort included in the 
University of Suffolk evaluation, when the 'live' offending rate of those receiving Diversion and those receiving a statutory pre-court outcome is compared Diversion cases offended at a lower rate. 20% of those who received a statutory pre-court outcome committed a further offence compared to just 12% for those referred to the Diversion Programme.

1. 	Review of Youth Justice Objectives 2018/19 
 
Reduce re-offending priority.  
The reoffending live tracker was fully implemented at the start of 2018. This tool identifies current cases where reoffending risk has increased during the previous week and triggers a management case review process where a high risk of re-offending is identified. An audit of cases which were identified for a management review has been completed and the findings reported to the management group.  
 
The service has also introduced a local binary re-offending rate which gives more up to date information about re-offending than the national indicator.  
The latest SYJS Out of Court Disposal report found that for those receiving a Diversion Crime intervention 16.4% went on to commit a further offence. This compares very favourably to a reoffending rate of 40% for young people in Suffolk who were cautioned (YJB figures). Young people who currently receive a Diversion Crime Intervention would receive a police caution if the Diversion Programme were not in place. For those young people receiving a Diversion Non-Crime intervention 10.2% went on to commit an offence. 
 
Trauma Informed Pilot. 
 
In Suffolk, some children and young people coming to the attention of SYJS are presenting with complex issues some related to criminal exploitation mainly through Gangs and County Lines.  The service is working with the Suffolk Psychology and Therapeutic Service to run a 2-year pilot in the Ipswich and the Suffolk Against Gangs Exploitation (SAGE) teams based on the Trauma Recovery Model. This places an emphasis on relationships and the sequencing of intervention.  The pilot which commenced in early 2018 includes a psychology led case formulation and reviews, consultancy and clinical supervision for staff and managers. All case holding staff across the service have also received training to raise awareness of the effects of trauma on young people. The pilot will be evaluated and depending on the findings and available resources at the time rolled out to the rest of the county.   
 
Disproportionality  
 
The latest SYJS Diversity report identified the following: 
There is a slight disproportionality of BAME children and young people in the caseload compared to the 10-17 population in the 2018 Suffolk school census. In the SYJS caseload 11.2% are BAME compared to 8.3% in the school census. There is a slightly higher disproportionality of BAME in the statutory caseload compared to the Diversion caseload (13.4% and 10.6% respectively). There is some disproportionality in different BAME categories. Black or Black British young people are overrepresented in SYJS caseload compared to the school census (2.7% of caseload in 2018 compared to 0.9 in census) while Asian and Asian British are underrepresented in SYJS caseload (1.2 compared to 1.7).   
All of the 9 Suffolk young people sentenced to custody in 2018 were White British. 
The most common nationality other than British in the SYJS caseload is Romanian making up 5% of the caseload. The cost of translation services in 2018/19 has nearly trebled compared to 2017/18 with the latest figures showing Romanian making up 64% of all translation requests by SYJS. 
There is still an over-representation of Children in Care (CiC). The proportion on the statutory caseload is double that of the diversion caseload (24.9% and 12.3% respectively), with both being significantly higher than the proportion of CIC for the whole of Suffolk (0.9% in the 10-17 population). 
The Children in Care protocol is in the process of being signed off. In June 2019 a task and finish group including the police and residential children's homes managers, fostering and SYJS met to begin working on implementing the protocol.   
 
Speech, Language and Communication Needs 
  
The SaLT service within SYJS improves access to SCLN services for families and delivers workforce development for Suffolk YJS staff. They provide assessment and one to one therapy for YP open to Suffolk YJS and support development of practice through targeted training. The service is now in year two, of a two-year pilot to embed SaLT provision in teams. The indication is that there is a high level of need in the caseload with 53% assessed as having a speech language or communication need in 2018. Demand for the service in year one outstripped the available provision; as a result, NHS England has reallocated resources set aside for an individual evaluation to increase provision in year two. The pilot will still be part of a national evaluation.  
 
Harmful Sexual Behaviour.  
A model has been developed and shared with partners and then further refined to focus on the most pressing priorities identified through the self -assessment in order to deliver this within existing resources.  Following discussion within Children and Young 
Peoples Services the HSB practice lead for CYP, supported by SYJS staff, will roll out awareness raising sessions across children's social care and early help teams in October and November to raise the profile and understanding of HSB work alongside the referral pathway and consultancy support available from SYJS. The HSB practice lead continues to deliver bespoke development and awareness raising sessions to other professionals across the children's workforce e.g.; school nurses.  
This will help to determine the level of need but if as expected raised awareness increases identification of cases, careful management of expectations will be required as SYJS has limited capacity to support this work. The HSB practice lead will consult with colleagues across children's social care and early help teams to agree a set of priorities to manage referrals should these increase to a level that exceeds the SYJS capacity to support.  
 
Gangs and County Lines 
 
SYJS has made a significant contribution to tacking the issues of gangs and county lines in Suffolk. The threat posed by County Lines (CL) and Urban Street Gangs (USG) in Suffolk has been well recognised and a detailed strategy and action plan is in place. The Diversion Programme is a key part of the early intervention and prevention part of both strategy and action plan.  SYJS is also funding the Suffolk County Lines and Gangs Managers post for a period of 2 years.  
SYJS hosts the SAGE team and has provided 2 staff members and administrative and budget support to the team. 
The innovative practice model which is being developed within the SAGE team is based on a combination of: 
a trauma informed practice model (which is being developed and piloted locally).  
A thinking skills group programme - (grant funded and being developed and delivered locally).  Contextual safeguarding  
Restorative approaches.  
Staff from across the service have attended both county wide awareness raising events for practitioners and more intensive train the trainer courses to equip them to deal with children and young people at risk of or involved in criminal exploitations.   
 
Service User Engagement 
  
During 2018 the service introduced an online survey to capture feedback from children and young people.  
The survey asks questions about what the children and young people think about Suffolk Youth Justice Service (SYJS), their worker(s) and activities that have been undertaken during their involvement with SYJS.  
95% who answered felt that their worker listened to them all of the time and the remaining young person felt listened to some of the time. 
All young people say they felt safe and unafraid when working with SYJS. 
All young people said their YOS worker asked them what they thought would stop them getting into trouble. 100% felt that things had got better during the time they were involved with SYJS. 
Having implemented the young people's feedback survey, the next step is to seek feedback from parents/carers. During 2019 SYJS will develop and implement a parent/carers feedback survey and aims to have collected initial feedback by April 2020. 
 
Direct Observation of Practice 
 
Each practitioner should participate in at least one direct observation a year. The observation includes a conversation between the observer and the child or young person to capture their views using the 'Tell Us What You Think'. There have been some challenges in terms of getting observations completed in 2018-due to management capacity. Feedback from direct observation also needs to be collated centrally to see if there are any emerging themes.  
 
 
Restorative Justice  
Feedback is collected from victims of youth crime as part of restorative justice. In the last available reporting period 97% of participants were satisfied with the restorative justice process they engaged in. 
 
Case Audits  
 
SYJS has recently reviewed how it audits cases and as part of this review has introduced processes to obtain young person and parent/carer feedback which will help to triangulate the results of the case record audits.  
 
Referral Order Practice  
 
During 2018-19 the cross-grade countywide Practice Development Group has led on redesigning referral order practice and procedures to place young people and parent carers views at the centre of the process.  
 
Restorative Justice  
 
During 2019-20 SYJS was due to go through the reaccreditation process for the Restorative Service Quality Mark (RSQM) awarded by the Restorative Justice Council (RJC). In the event SYJS was notified by the RJC that the reaccreditation process was on hold.  
SYJS has continued to work to ensure that it maintains the required standard.  
A reaccreditation plan has been agreed and a programme of work commenced to ensure SYJS continues to meet the reaccreditation standard going forward into 2020, this will include audits, a review of policies and practice guidance, refocussing events with managers and staff, and further training of relevant staff.  It is anticipated that the RJC will visit the service in Spring 2020 to inspect this work.  
 
 
 
2.	Governance 
The Suffolk Youth Justice Management Board includes representation from key partners including; Suffolk County Council (SCC) 
Children and Young Peoples Services, Suffolk Constabulary, The National Probation Service and the Clinical Commissioning Groups in Suffolk. In addition, Public Health, Suffolk Family Focus (Troubled Families Programme), the Voluntary Sector and SCC localities and partnerships and courts are also members. The Board is chaired by the SCC Director of Children's Services and holds the partnership to account and oversees the delivery of Youth Justice Services in Suffolk. Performance reports and updates are regularly provided to the Board on: 
National Indicators: Re-offending binary and frequency rates, First Time Entrants to the Youth Justice System and Use of Custody rates. Locally agreed Indicators: As well as tracking performance on local indicators, this includes periodic information on specific themes for example in 2018 -19, reports analysing Offences and Sentencing, Desistance (for and against) and Diversity were presented to the SYJS management board. Incidents which would previously have been submitted to the YJB as Community Safety and Public Protection Incidents, are also reported to the Board if a review is not being carried out elsewhere in the system as part of a locally agreed process. 
The Board supports the Service in overcoming barriers to effective multi-agency working and ensures that partner agencies make an effective contribution to delivering against key youth justice outcomes and that the terms of conditions of the Youth Justice Grant are adhered to. 
In 2018-19 two development events for board members have been held. The first was a refresh for existing, and induction for new board members on their role and responsibilities. The second offered an opportunity for board members to meet staff and managers from across the service and learn more about all aspects of the work of the service.   Links between the service and the Police and Crime Commissioners office have also been strengthened in 2018-19.

4.	Structure  
SYJS sits within Suffolk Children's Services and benefits from the close working relationships with Children's Early Help, Social Care, and the Leaving Care Service. This is supported by team co-location with Leaving Care Teams in all locations and by colocation with a wide range of Children's Services partners in the West. The three SYJS local teams are based in the main centres of population, Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds and Lowestoft and include seconded police officers, a probation officer, substance misuse workers and Primary Mental Health Workers (PMHWs) and educational psychologist and speech language and communication therapists. All provision is available equally to both statutory and Diversion cases. 
SYJS is represented on: 
• The Local Criminal Justice Board 
• Stronger and Safer Communities Group  
• Suffolk Constabulary Children and Young Peoples Steering Group  
• MAPPA Strategic Management Board 
• IOM Governance Board 
• Exploited Children Sub-Group of The Suffolk Safeguarding Children's Board 
• The County Lines and Gang Violence Steering Group and Leadership Group • Post -16 participation in education meeting  
• Safer in School Board.  
• Children's Emotional Wellbeing Group. 
• Community safety partnerships 
SYJS also attends the Suffolk Youth Court Panel and is part of the External Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny Panel.

7.  Practice and Performance  
The work we are delivering  
At the start of April 2019 SYJS was delivering 195 interventions to 190 unique young people. These included 87 court ordered interventions; 93 diversion interventions; 15 harmful sexual behaviour (HSB) interventions and 23 young people were assessed as involved in gangs or county lines. Work undertaken as part of the Diversion Programme now makes up over 50% of the total work of the service.  In 2018 as a whole 73% of the caseload was male; 74% were aged 15 or over; 10% were from a BAME background 
(compared to 8.3% of the total 10-17 year-old population in Suffolk); 13% were a child in care (0.9% in Suffolk); 44% were assessed as having special educational needs (1.8% in Suffolk).  
Sentencing and Offences 
The report analysing sentencing and offences presented to SYJS Management Board in December 2018 showed that the total number of court outcomes given in 2018 was lower than previous years and there had been a 30% reduction in offences sentenced between 2016 and 2018. The analysis also showed that 16-17-year-olds commit more than half of all offences committed by 10-17 year-olds in Suffolk and that 'violence against the person' is the most common offence across both genders and all age groups except the 10-11 year-olds where 'criminal damage' is more common. Overall more than a third of all offences committed by children and young people in Suffolk are 'violence against the person'. 
Desistance 
An analysis of factors for and against desistance was presented to the SYJS Management Board in June 2019. Key findings from the report were: The top three factors which support desistance are: 
* Learning, education, training and employment which is a factor for 66.2% of children and young people assessed 
* Engagement and participation, which is a factor for 60.6% of children and young people assessed 
* Family and wider networks, which is a factor for 54.2% of children and young people assessed The top three factors which hinder desistance are: 
• Thinking and behaviour, which is a factor in 49.3% of assessments 
• Emotional and mental health, which is a factor in 42.3% of assessments 
• Family and wider networks, which is a factor in 40.1% of assessments 
• A quarter of all children assessed have experienced violence or abusive behaviour in the wider family, and nearly a fifth of assessments indicated violence or abuse towards the young person from others. 
• Of those with 'family and wider networks' listed as a factor against desistance 72% had either 'experiences of loss or bereavement' or 'loss of contact with people significant to the young person'. 
• Of those with 'learning, education, training and employment' listed as a factor against desistance 67.9% had attendance or participation issues, and 30.4 % had a complex history e.g. moves, disruptions and previous exclusions.

National Indicators - cont'd Chart 2: First time entrants:  
The rate of first-time entrants has continued to decrease in Suffolk. The latest rate is 177 per 100,000 10-17-year olds (down from 194 in the previous quarter). This equates to just 118 children and young people in the 12-month period Jan 2018 to December 2018. The FTE rate in Suffolk is lower than the Eastern region, the YOT Family and National rates.   Chart 3 and 4: Reoffending measures:  
The reoffending measures are based on the statutory cohort. In late 2017 the Ministry of Justice changed how the data for the reoffending measures (frequency and binary) is captured. The measures are now based on a 3-month cohort rather than a 12month cohort and so is much more likely to change significantly from one quarter to the next due to the smaller cohort numbers. 
In the 2018/19, the number of young people in the statutory cohort decreased but they committed a similar number of offences in total. This led to an increase in re-offending frequency (4.57 to 5.03) but a reduction in Suffolk's binary reoffending rate from 51% to 46.5%.   
Chart 5: Use of Custody:  
Suffolk's use of custody continued to decrease (from 0.26 to 0.09 per 1,000 of the 10-17 population in 2018/19) and is now well below both national and regional levels.  The actual number of Suffolk young people in custody has reduced from 15 to 6 in the same period. 
 	 
8. Overall Priorities for 2019 - 22  
Governance and Leadership 
The service will continue to work with the Management Board to strengthen governance arrangements and SYJS links to relevant initiatives, strategies and policies across the partnership.  The Service plans to hold a whole service event in 2020/21 for staff, partners and the management board and to introduce named deputies for board members to increase board resilience.  
The Management Board will support SYJS to address the operating budget shortfall which has been an issue for some years and over the next three years will explore options to achieve a sustainable balanced budget and a resilient operating model. The ability to deliver on the priorities outlined below will depend to some extent on capacity across the service and the Board will consider this and agree what can and cannot be delivered depending on agreed resources. The service is also delivering pilot projects, such as the trauma informed practice model and subject to evaluation the Management Board will also consider how to mainstream and roll these out countywide.  
SYJS will review opportunities for workforce progression and development to increase workforce stability and staff satisfaction. 
Practice 
In the next three years Suffolk Youth Justice Service will continue to work with Suffolk Constabulary and other partners including the voluntary sector to intervene early by delivering prevention, early intervention and diversion for young people at risk of or starting to become involved in offending and anti-social behaviour.  
For the few children and young people who are engaged in serious offending, particularly youth violence, we will continue to develop our practice in line with effective practice principles. The Service will also ensure that our staff are supported and developed and that our interventions are tailored to achieve the best outcomes for this cohort. 
The service will develop more consistent processes to ensure that service user feedback is collated and used to improve service delivery. It will also ensure that children and young people, parent/carers, volunteers, victims and courts are routinely informed about how their views and feedback has been used to improve service delivery.  
The service will also work to enhance the use of restorative justice.  
 
Partnership Priorities  
Further work will also be undertaken by the partnership to:  
• understand and try to address disproportionality in the Youth Justice System 
• Improve the rates of engagement in education, training and employment for young people in Suffolk who are in or on the edges of the Youth Justice System 
 
9.   Specific Priorities for 2019/20 
Governance 
In 2019-20 the Management Board will continue to encourage staff members to attend board meetings and consideration will be given to developing an area of the SYJS website for board members. A basic information pack which will be used as part of new board member induction but also as a reference document for existing board members in their wider role will also be developed.   
The Management Board will also complete a self-audit against the criteria and expectations of management boards contained within the YJB Standards for Children in the Youth Justice System and use the findings from this to further develop the work of the board 
 
Developing Service User Engagement 
In 2019 -20 SYJS will: 
• Collect and collate child and young person feedback obtained as part of the case audit process.  
• Work with the courts in developing measures to collect and collate sentencer's feedback on the work of the service.  
• Introducing an online survey to collect the views of parents and carers on the work of SYJS.  
 
 
Education, Training and Employment (ETE)  
In 2019-20 SYJS will review with partners, the cases of all young people who are not currently in education training or employment, or who do not have an appropriate offer that is meeting their needs with the aim of increasing the number of young people who are either in full time education or are participating in education, employment or training if they are above statutory school age.  
As previously referenced there is a high level of special education need (SEN)  identified within the caseload, SYJS will continue to work with partners, linked to the Suffolk SEND Strategy and priorities to ensure that children and young people are being correctly assessed and are able to access services to support educational attainment and meet their potential 
The service will work with partners to improve the current referral pathways and access to services both at an operational and strategic level by: 
• Completing a review of cases, where ETE has been assessed as a factor against desistance and identify next steps with partners to address the issues identified 
• Carry out a self-assessment against the relevant national standards  
• Ensure that service is engaging with local arrangements for ensuring children and young people have an appropriate education, training or employment offer e.g.; In Year Fair Access Panel (IYFAP), Multi-Agency Assessment Programme (MAAP) to ensure early and timely assessment of need, either with or without an EHC plan,  
 
Improving Practice  
In 2019 -20 SYJS will improve the quality of practice by: 
• Considering how to mainstream the trauma informed pilot and extend it countywide.  
• Working with partners to mainstream SaLT provision. 
• Completing an audit of the identification and management of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) case with a focus on those managed at Level 1.  
• Increasing the amount of RJ work delivered from current level of 70% (statutory) / 61% (diversion) to a consistent target level of 75% 
• The service will develop its own set of standards based on and incorporating the YJB Standards in the Youth Justice System and conduct a self-assessment against them.  
• Reviewing case management policies and practice in light of the new standards.  
• Audit re-offending reviews using a 12-month case sample and monitor reviews to ensure they are consistently completed.  
 
Disproportionality  
• The service will commission the delivery of unconscious bias training to staff 
• SYJS will discuss with court partners delivering unconscious bias training to youth magistrates and court staff.   
• Introduce a statement on all court reports which states the services commitment to tacking disproportionality.  
• Establish a Task and Finish group to operationalise the Unnecessary Criminalisation of Children in Care Protocol 
• The service will contribute to the development of the Unnecessary Criminalisation of Children Leaving Care Protocol 
 
Recruitment and Retention of a skilled workforce.  
SYJS will: 
• review opportunities for progression and career development within the service and with partner agencies.  
• The service will also review the training offer it currently makes to staff and consider offering an option to work toward the Youth Justice Degree.  
• The service will continue to recognise and celebrate good practice.  
 
Serious Youth Violence  
• SYJS will continue to direct 2 staff to work in the SAGE team 
• Contribute to the Multi-agency risk panels.  
• Ensure one member of staff is trained in gangs and county lines to train the trainer level in each team.  
 
10.  Risks to Future Delivery Against the Youth Justice Outcome Measures  
 Funding/Resources  
• SYOS is functioning with an operational budget shortfall in excess of £100k per annum.  
• Further funding or in-kind cuts from partners or the YJB, are very likely to compromise the Service's ability to deliver all aspects of its current work and will negatively affect performance.  
• There is a lack of resilience across SYOS so there is very limited scope to respond to additional demand.  
• Non-staffing costs may fluctuate and exceed the allocated budget. 
• There is limited scope within the budget to respond to any unexpected financial demands. 
• Partner organisations are under resource pressure which may limit the scope and effectiveness of partnership working.  
• Resourcing across the public sector affects access to a wide range of services which support children and young people.  This may affect any or all of the youth justice outcome measures.  
• Time limited funding for SaLT dedicated resource, Trauma Informed pilot and the additional police resource to support delivery of the Diversion model  
Mitigation 
• The re-structure proposed in 2017-18 can be revisited although this carries the risk of reducing staff morale and thus increasing the retention issues identified below. 
• The Board could agree that specified areas of SYOS work are no longer delivered  
• Working with partners to explore opportunities to mainstream the current time limited pilots 
 
Custody 
• County lines/gang involvement of young people is a recognised risk factor for more serious and frequent offending, and this may increase the risk of young people receiving custodial sentences.  
• The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance requirement is very resource intensive to deliver especially when there is limited/no ETE provision in place. If it is not possible to provide an ISS in individual cases this would increase the risk of a custodial outcome.   Mitigation  
• The service will deliver a programme of development for all court staff including a county wide court practice group.  
• The service will continue to attend the IYFAP meeting to advocate for educational provision.  
• The service is working with partners to consider increasing the current speech language and communication provision in teams which will enable better identification of young people who are likely to present negatively in court. This would provide specialist advice and support to assist them as well as information for sentencers.  
 
Re-offending  
• As identified last year there is a risk that performance on the two re-offending measures will continue to deteriorate as the resources available to the service reduce. Intensive work with the increasingly complex statutory cohort is one amongst many competing priorities that are becoming increasingly difficult to balance.  
• The delivery of the trauma informed practice model is resource intensive and this may impact on our ability to mainstream it and roll the model out on a county wide basis.  
Mitigation  
• The service will continue to monitor the effectiveness and consistency of the re-offending case review process  
 
First Time Entrants  
• As outlined under re-offending there is an increasing difficulty in balancing resources to work intensively with the statutory cohort whilst at the same time continuing to focus on prevention and early intervention. 
Mitigation  
• The service will monitor whether the changes to the Diversion model implemented in 2018/19 have been effective 
• The Board could agree that specified areas of The Diversion Programme cease to be delivered.  
 
 
Performance 
• The service will consider whether the current the case management system is delivering best value for money in 2019/20 and  if a new system is obtained this is likely to impact on performance and staff capacity in the implementation stages and whilst a new recording system is 'bedding' in 
Mitigation 
• The service will develop a comprehensive implementation plan with oversight by the Management Board to reduce the adverse impact wherever possible
