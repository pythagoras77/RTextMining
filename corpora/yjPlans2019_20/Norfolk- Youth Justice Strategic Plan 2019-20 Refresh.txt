The existing 2018-21 Norfolk Youth Justice Plan has been refreshed in 2019-20 to outline the actions, risks and opportunities identified to ensure that desired outcomes for young people and the victims of their crime are achieved by Norfolk Youth Offending Team.  The Plan sets out the key external and internal drivers behind this area of the County Council's work which is delivered in partnership with the required statutory agencies on the Norfolk Youth Justice Board (Health, Police and Probation); and others such as the County Community Safety Partnership, Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner and the Norfolk and Suffolk Criminal Justice Board.   
In March 2019 the Norfolk Youth Justice Board held a 'Setting the Strategic Direction' workshop. The Chair of the Board and the YOT Management Team delivered a series of presentations on future challenges for 2019-20 and our progress and achievements in the previous in 2018-19. The Board subsequently agreed the 2019-20 priorities at the March 2019 Board meeting. 
The refreshed Norfolk Youth Justice Plan will be submitted to the Youth Justice Board for approval by 5 August 2019.  
It will be presented with an accompanying report by the Executive Director of Children's Services to Cabinet on 5 August 2019 and to Full Council on 23 September 2019.   
The national Youth Justice Board last issued the Youth Justice Plan: YJB Practice Note for Youth Offending Partnerships on 18th April 2019, which offered guidance regarding the content and structure of the Youth Justice Plan.  The requirements of this guidance are incorporated in this Plan.  
 	 
Welcome to the 2019-20 refresh of the 2018-21 Norfolk Youth Justice Plan. The Plan gives an overview of the work of the Norfolk Youth Offending Team and partnership Board, sets out details of performance over the past year and our priorities for the coming year and beyond.  
The refreshed Norfolk YOT priorities for 2019-20 are contained in page 12 onwards.  
The Norfolk Youth Justice Board priorities in support of the above are as follows: 
• Ensure that Norfolk YOT is sufficiently resourced to maintain its current service delivery levels in 2020 and beyond.  
 
• Ensure that there is sufficient additional resource to support the YOT contribution to a Multi-Agency Child Criminal Exploitation Team in 202021 and beyond. 
 
• Champion the YOT priority to reduce the number of children and young people in contact with the Youth Justice System who are not in or receiving mainstream education.  
 
• Ensure the provision of dedicated psychological resources to support a trauma informed approach for children and young people in the youth justice system. 
 
• Promote the application of the national Youth Justice Board's principle of 'Child First, Offender Second' in Norfolk.  
 
On behalf of the Norfolk Youth Justice Board I am pleased to present this refreshed update of the 2018-21 Norfolk Youth Justice Plan. 
 
Sara Tough, Chair of the Norfolk YOT Management Board and Executive Director of Children Services.  
 Children in the justice system often have multiple and complex needs. Where possible we seek to divert children from the justice system entirely and address these needs elsewhere. For those who do offend, our core focus must continue to be rehabilitation, tackling the underlying causes of youth offending, and delivering a system that gives children the support they need to break the cycle of offending and build productive and fulfilling lives. Norfolk YOT adopts the Youth Justice Board's principles, vision and aims in its work with those in the justice system as follows:   
Principle: All agencies should consider children involved in the youth justice system as a 'child first and offender second'.   
Vision: We will see children as children, treat them fairly and help them to build on their strengths so they can make a constructive contribution to society.  This will prevent offending and create safer communities with fewer victims 
Aims:  
• Reduce the number of children in the youth justice system 
• Reduce reoffending by children in the youth justice system 
• Improve the safety and wellbeing of children in the youth justice system 
• Improve outcomes for children in the youth justice system 
 
In Norfolk we continue to work together in partnership to make our communities, families, children and young people safe; the Youth Offending Team has a key role to play. Norfolk YOT does this by working together with its key partners - the Police, the Police and Crime Commissioner, Norfolk County Council Children's 
Services, Health Services, especially the Clinical Commissioning Groups and Public Health, the National Probation Service and the wider Community Safety Partnership - to deliver high quality and effective services to young people, their families and the victims of their offending. The overall effectiveness of the YOT continues to be monitored by the Government against three key national indicators which are linked directly to the Service's core aims. Our vision for Norfolk children and young people is that they will be safe and live with resourceful and resilient families. 
They will live in inclusive and supportive communities, have access to high quality education and training and have opportunities to thrive in adulthood. 
In line with Norfolk County Council's strategy 2018-21, we will be guided by the following key principles:  • Offering our help early to prevent and reduce demand for specialist services    • Joining up our work so that similar activities and services are easily accessible, done well and done once   • Being business-like and making best use of digital technology 
to ensure value for money   • Using evidence and data to target our work where it can make the most difference 

What we will do 
 	 
Aims: 
• Norfolk Youth Offending Team (Norfolk YOT) is a statutory multiagency partnership hosted within Norfolk County Council. 
• Our purpose is to prevent children and young people from offending whilst safeguarding their welfare, protecting the public and helping restore the damage caused to the victims of their crimes. 
• Our aim is to make Norfolk an even safer place to live and help young people achieve their full potential in life. 
• We aim to meet the diverse needs of people in Norfolk involved in or affected by offending. 
Outcomes: will focus on those prioritised nationally by the national Youth Justice Board Strategic Plan, which are: 
• Reduce the number of children in the youth justice system 
• Reduce reoffending by children in the youth justice system

• The Norfolk YOT Management Board is active in setting the strategic direction and priorities for Norfolk YOT. 

Review of 2018/19 
 
 
In December 2018 the longstanding chair of the Norfolk Youth Justice Board, the previous Managing Director of Norfolk County Council, stood down. The Board was pleased to welcome the Executive Director of Children's Services to the role of Chair in February 2019.  
During the latter part of 2018 an internal review of the Norfolk Youth Justice Board was undertaken, and several recommendations made. One of those recommendations was to seek a recommitment from current Board members and expand partner representation. In 2019 the Board welcomes six new members to provide senior representation from Education Inclusion, District Councils, the County Community Safety Partnership, a health clinician representing the five Clinical Commissioning Groups in the county and the Norfolk & Suffolk Community Rehabilitation Company.   
In March 2019 the Norfolk Youth Justice Board held a 'Setting the Strategic Direction' workshop. The Chair of the Board and the YOT Management Team delivered a series of presentations on future challenges for 2019-20 and our progress and achievements against the 2018-19 annual plan. The Board subsequently agreed the 201920 plan priorities at the March 2019 Board meeting and those priorities are contained in this refreshed plan.   
During 2018-19 Norfolk YOT has focused on developing staff understanding of the new criteria and preparation for a potential inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP). The Norfolk YOT HMIP Working Group has reviewed published YOT inspections to support our understanding and attended the national Youth Justice Board HMIP Workshop. We are currently implementing relevant recommendations from the HMIP Thematic inspection on Out of Court Disposals. A Norfolk YOT case has been selected for the HMIP Thematic Inspection on Resettlement.  
During 2018-19, Norfolk YOT has hosted and partly resourced a pilot, multi-agency, Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) Team comprising YOT staff, Police, Social Care and most recently Family Practitioners through recruitment funded by the Early Intervention Youth Fund (EIYF). The CCE team is funded to March 2020 and the forward challenge will be ensuring that if the pilot approach is deemed successful, it is sufficiently funded and resourced and becomes mainstream practice.   
As part of the Norfolk County Community Safety Partnership (CCSP), Norfolk YOT made a financial contribution to the CCSP Serious Violence Coordinator post and will be working closely with the post holder both strategically and operationally to address the issue of serious youth violence in Norfolk.    
The caseload of Norfolk YOT has seen a rise in the number of diversion (Challenge 4 Change) cases and this currently represents almost 50% of the overall caseload.  
Our reported First-Time Entrants performance has improved significantly since the launch of Challenge 4 Change in June 2015.  
Our use of custody remains low, despite the backdrop of increasing youth violence, knife crime and criminal exploitation both in Norfolk and nationally.  
Reoffending remains problematic and adversely affected by the smaller numbers in the cohort and the complexity of those cases. 
We continue to develop our practice and approach to FTEs and reoffending as is evidenced by our Priorities for 2019-20.   
Partnership Arrangements & Governance 
  • Direct governance arrangements for the Youth Offending Team (YOT) are through the Norfolk YOT Partnership Board, which is chaired by the Executive 
Director of Children Services. As well as the statutory partners the Board includes additional representation from the Countywide Community Safety Partnership, Housing Services, Norfolk's Police and Crime Commissioner, Public Health, representatives from Norfolk's Borough, City and District Councils and Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service.   
 • 
   As a statutory requirement of the legislation under which the YOT was formed in January 2000, practitioners are seconded from the Police, Health, NCC Children's Services (including discrete representation from social work and education) and the National Probation Service.  We also directly employ practitioners with skills in achieving positive change, reducing substance misuse, delivering restorative justice and community reparation and working with parents. • The YOT is represented by the Head of Service or nominated YOT strategic lead on a wide range of partnership boards and contributes to their action plans and strategic direction.  These currently include the Norfolk Safeguarding Children Board, the Local Criminal Justice Board, the Child Criminal Exploitation Partnership sub-group, the NSCB Child Sexual Abuse sub-group, the County Community Safety Partnership, the PCC's Reducing Reoffending 
Board, the CAMHS Strategic Partnership Board, the MAPPA Strategic Management Board, the Early Help Board and the PREVENT Board.  The Norfolk YOT Management Board is represented by its Chair on the Norfolk Public Protection Forum (NPPF) comprising of all chairs of strategic multi-agency groups with a key role to put in place effective arrangements for ensuring that people in Norfolk, particularly the most vulnerable in our society, are properly protected.   
 • The YOT hosts the Children's Services Restorative Approaches Team and sits on the Restorative Approaches Strategic Board.  
 • The YOT hosts the Harmful Sexual Behaviour Project a CAMHS /Local Transformation Plan funded initiative.  
 • Services delivered by Norfolk YOT contribute directly to the delivery of other corporate strategies including the County Council 'Norfolk Futures' vision and strategy for 2018-2021 and within this the Norfolk Children's Services priority 'Safe Children and Resilient Families'. 
 • The YOT has also contributed to the County Community Safety Partnership Priorities.    
 • Jointly with Police and Adult Services, the YOT commissions an Appropriate Adult Service for children and young people.  Partnership Arrangements & Governance 
 
 
What the Board will do to ensure effective governance:  
 
• Oversee the effective delivery of youth justice services and set the strategic direction. 
• Monitor YOT performance against both National and local indicators by scrutinising comprehensive quarterly performance reports and agreeing actions for improvement where needed. 
• Define the priority areas for scrutiny including current practice and approaches.   
• Review Community Safeguarding and Public Protection Incidents and National Standards Audits. 
• Scrutinise the YOT annual spending to ensure that all core YOT services are delivered within the allocated budget and that the Youth Justice Board grant conditions are fully complied with. 
• Ensure that the YOT is fully integrated into and able to influence strategic developments with which partners are engaged.  
 
  
All key partners are represented on the Management Board.  
The Board will extend its membership to other partners to ensure the progression of a specific development issue.  This ensures the Board is best placed to address any barriers to effective multiagency working and can therefore make an effective contribution to delivering outcomes. 
Our primary customers are children and young people in the youth justice system, their families and the victims of their crimes. We also work with children and young people and their families to prevent them entering the youth justice system. 
Secondary customers would include all communities in Norfolk who are affected by the criminal and antisocial behaviour of children and young people that we are trying to reduce and prevent. 
Norfolk Youth Offending Team (YOT) is committed to ensuring that children, young people and their families have a voice and influence in the youth justice system and Norfolk YOT has an established service user participation and involvement strategy. This strategy includes several tools and mechanisms for routinely seeking the views of children and young people on the services they receive.   
  
Key priorities for 2018-21: 
 
• Ensure the YOT fully implements the 2018-21 Youth Justice Plan priorities and that this is reviewed on an annual basis. 
• Deliver the Norfolk Youth Justice Board priorities in support of the Youth Justice Plan.  
• Ensure the YOT has sufficient resources to 
deliver the Youth Justice Plan 
• Ensure key agencies are represented at an appropriate level on the Management Board. 
• Ensure the YOT maintains a strong level of performance against the National Indicators and delivers its priorities each year. 
• Critically investigate areas where performance is poor to ensure that this analysis informs partnership developments. 
• In 2019-20 work with new board members to understand their role in relation to the Youth Justice Board's 'Modern Youth Offending Partnerships - Guidance on Effective Youth Offending Team Governance in England'. 
 
National Indicators - First Time Entrants and Custody 
 	 
 
First Time Entrant Analysis: 
The joint diversion project Challenge 4 Change between Norfolk YOT and Norfolk Constabulary continues to impact on reductions in FTEs quarter on quarter. The gap for the per 100,000 rate for Norfolk (as the graph demonstrates) has closed considerably to the regional and national picture. It was anticipated the reductions would narrow over time and that has happened, but small reductions have continued and in the most recent period the FTEs reduced by a further 20.8%.  
The piloting of an Out of Court Disposal Panel approach in Norwich is underway and if successful will be expanded across the County to support further reductions in FTE numbers.   
Custody Analysis: 
Custodial numbers have been a success story over the last year with the most recent quarter only seeing 2 new custodial sentences, which is the lowest number for over 3 years. Performance over the last year has improved so much that the rate is considerably better than the regional and national rates (0.30 and 0.31 respectively) when compared to NYOT's rate of 0.21. 
The increase in violence, knife crime and drug supply offences is a risk factor in our ability to ensure that the use of custody is reserved for the most serious offences.    
 
  	
National Indicators - Reoffending, Indicator Risks and Actions 
 	 

Reoffending Analysis: 
Reoffending rates are still rising but looked at over time the linear trend shows that this is up by only 2%, fluctuating between 37% and 47%. Further work has gone into understanding the cohort and what is demonstrable is that the overall size of the cohort is the biggest factor between good performance and poor performance. When we perform well by keeping young people out of the criminal justice system, the smaller cohort in the criminal justice system results in poorer reoffending performance.  
Analysis of various demographics took place to identify where reoffending is at its worst. This showed that by the ages of 15-17 reoffending hits its peak. If we are to affect real change, working differently with young people who come into the criminal justice at an early age is the best way to tackle future reoffending. 
We will prioritise this approach in 2019-20 on onwards.  Indicator Risks 
First Time Entrants 
FTEs are at an historic low. The numbers of young people being exploited in the supply of drugs remains a significant factor in our ability to maintain a reducing trend.  
 
Custody 
Exploitation resulting in violence, knife crime and drug supply offences may affect our ability to maintain low custody rates. Our multi-agency and early intervention response continues to be a priority.   
 
Reoffending 
Continued success in the FTE indicator could lead to a permanently challenging position for reoffending rates. We anticipate that our new ways of working will impact in the longer term.  Indicator Actions 
First Time Entrants 
• Review the impact of the 6-month OOCD Panel Pilot in Norwich 
• Respond effectively to risk factors such as emotional trauma and other adverse events in young people's lives at the earliest opportunity 
 
Custody 
• Break the cycle and pattern of Child Criminal Exploitation. 
 
Reoffending 
• Develop a psychologically informed intervention approach for 11-13yearolds 
• Investigate and trial the Northamptonshire YRO review approach 
• Contribute to the development of the national LAC/LC protocol and improve our approach to 'reducing unnecessary criminalisation of looked after children and care leavers' Finance

The tentative gross income for 2019/20 is £3,717,204 which includes a predicted 'in-kind' contribution from partners of £969,872 in respect of seconded practitioners.  Norfolk YOT does not have a base budget, but each year seeks a contribution from the four statutory funding partners and the Police and Crime Commissioner.  Additionally, several grants are received for specific purposes that are all included within the gross income amount.  This year the YOT grant, currently has a reduction from the Youth Justice Board of £6,899.  All other contributions have been maintained at 2018/19 levels, with inflation where applicable. 
Norfolk YOT is around the group average based on an Internal value for money analysis of Eastern and the YOT Family group.  When compared to comparator YOTs below, the median budget reduction in 2017/18 was £64,356. Norfolk's budget reduction was £394,348 in that period. Norfolk also has the lowest spend in relation to Budget per statutory disposal at £5,962 with the highest being £24,254 (for the purposes of this calculation only funding from statutory partners is included). 
Service Users 
 
Service user feedback is based on data gathered from an internally developed, Smart Survey feedback form that replaced both the previous ViewPoint Intervention Quality Evaluation and the HMIP Viewpoint questionnaire from the beginning of July 2017.  The survey is competed in the last month of the young person's involvement with Norfolk YOT.  In the year 2018-19: 
• 48 responses were completed (a 12% increase on last year), this is 21% of the cases that closed in the period.  National returns for similar youth justice-based service user feedback processes average around 20%, so we have picked back up to our previous rate of completion quickly given this is a new questionnaire tool. 
• 37 (68%) were completed by 15 to 18 year olds, which is down on previous reports (>80%) reflecting a younger caseload.  The mode being shared between 15 and 17 year olds 
• 82% (39) respondents were male  
• 45 described themselves as 'White British' two of the other three as 'White European' and the third, 'preferred not to say'. 
• All said they preferred English as their first language. 
 
Since 2015/16 service user engagement work within Norfolk YOT has included the involvement of young people in recruitment practices.  Several Norfolk YOT staff, have been trained to support young people's participation in the staff recruitment and selection process. Young people who are current service users have been involved in the design of interview questions, direct involvement in interview panels and contributing to the final selection of candidates

Appendix 3 - Youth Justice Grant 
 
 
 
The 2019/20 terms and conditions of the Youth Justice (YOT) Grant (England), including funding for Junior Attendance Centres in Great Yarmouth and Norwich provided to Norfolk County Council by the Youth Justice Board require assurance that they will be used exclusively for the delivery of youth justice services. 
 
Norfolk YOT will implement and comply with the new 2019 National Standards, data reporting requirements and the provision of mandatory documents for the placement of young people in the secure estate. This will include maintaining and updating a case management system which interacts as required with the youth justice system through Connectivity. AssetPlus is the assessment and planning framework used by Norfolk YOT. Norfolk County Council has no longstanding level of debt to the YJB in respect to requirements on local authorities designated by the courts to meet the cost of the secure remand of young people. 
 
The Youth Justice (YOT) Grant (England) 2019/20 will be fully spent on delivering the priorities outlined in the plan; specifically, but not exclusively including: 
 
• Reduce the numbers of young people who offend in the first place (First-time Entrants) 
• Ensure Norfolk YOT delivers accurate assessments that lead to effective plans designed to promote desistance factors for young people 
• Ensure that all young people in receipt of interventions through Norfolk YOT are treated as individuals and disproportionate activity is minimised 
• Work in partnership to assist the development of the Early Help Strategy in Norfolk 
• Further reduce the number and proportion of young people who re-offend 
• Deliver appropriate actions against relevant recommendations from various Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation and Criminal Justice Joint Inspection thematic inspection reports 
• Maximise the engagement of victims in restorative processes 
• Improve understanding of and responses to the emergence of County Lines, serious youth violence and gang related behaviours in Norfolk 
• Maximise the use of community orders and minimise the use of custody. 
• Reduce the average number of young people remanded to custody and the total bed-nights occupied in relation to the last 3 year average. 
 
The Chair of the Norfolk Youth Justice Board, the Local Authority Chief Finance Officer and the Head of Youth Offending Service have, as required, signed their agreement that the terms and conditions of the Youth Justice Board's various grants will be met. Failure to comply with these terms and conditions will enable the YJB to withhold or withdraw the grant at any time, and to require the repayment in whole or in part of any sums already paid. 
 
The Norfolk Youth Justice Board has oversight of the use of the Grant including a financial and performance report at each of its quarterly meetings. Additionally, reports regarding a number of other items detailed in the terms and conditions including those relating to legal and data requirements as well as matters of practice described in  'Standards for children in Youth Justice Services', the YJB Case Management Guidance and the placement of young people in custody reporting requirements are brought to the Board on a periodic basis throughout the year as and when required or appropriate.  Norfolk YOT and its management board have a strong history of compliance with such matters.
