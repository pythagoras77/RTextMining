1. Introduction to the South Gloucestershire Youth Justice Plan
1.1 Aim and Purpose of the Youth Justice Plan:
The Youth Justice Plan is produced as a requirement under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Every Local Authority must: 

a) Produce an annual Youth Justice Plan that sets out (as a minimum): 
* how youth justice services in their area are to be provided and funded; and 
* how the youth offending team or teams established by them are to be composed and funded, how they are to operate, and what functions they are to carry out.
b) Publish its Youth Justice Plan.

It is expected that Youth Justice Plan will be produced in line with their local business planning processes and timescales. 

1.2 The Youth Justice Plan is part of the oversight of Youth Offending Services. This oversight now centres on three key youth justice outcomes:
1. Reducing the number of first-time entrants (FTEs) to the youth justice system.
2. Reducing reoffending. 
3. Reducing custody numbers. 
The Youth Justice Partnership Board will prioritise performance in these three areas across agencies and thereby aim:
   4.	To improve the impact of the Youth Justice Partnership on achieving positive outcomes.
1.3 	The Youth Justice Plan should address the following four key areas:
* Structure and governance
* Resourcing and value for money
* Partnership arrangements
* Risks to future delivery.

1.4	The Youth Justice Plan will complement and reflect the Plans from partner agencies, including those from the Safer & Stronger Communities Strategic Partnership, The Children, Young People and Families Partnership, the Local Safeguarding Children's Board, the Police & Crime Commissioner's Office, the Police and local health Plans. 

1.5 The Plan must be signed off by all statutory partners.

1.6	Summary of achievements in 2018-19
* The YOS has continued to perform well against the three key performance indicators - First Time Entrants, Custody and Reoffending (see Appendix 4). 
* Involvement of victims in restorative processes continues to be low but this year has seen some improvements in the participation of victims in face-to-face processes, in the use of Community Resolutions with a victim element, and also some extensive communication with victims to determine their views and discuss outcomes. The YOT continues to commit to use of Community Resolutions as a Panel outcome to facilitate and encourage victim contact.  
* All YOT staff have now completed the Youth Justice Trauma Recovery Training.
* Continued development of the Harmful Sexual Behaviour service across Integrated Children's Services. Working alongside social workers at early stages of notification to support safety planning and begin engagement process. 
* 6 monthly YOT quality assurance audits. November 2018 focussed on post court cases with an emphasis on HMIP criteria, May 2018 focussed on pre-court cases. Actions around training undertaken.
* A significant number of YOT staff have received Connect 5 training (Royal Society for Public Health) offering input around working with young people's and their families emotional well-being.
* Development of a Boy's Programme (ManKind) which has been developed by the YOT Youth Justice Support Worker and has been piloted successfully with a number of YP (more information here).
* YOT's involvement in regular multi-agency Exploitation Case Audits, which is reported through the LSCB
* YOT's contribution to the development of the new Safeguarding arrangements due to be implemented.
* Operation Topaz - attends fortnightly multi-agency meetings led by the CSE Police Team.
* Contributed to the developments around a new Early Help Strategy - specifically in relation to the Adolescent work stream.
* The introduction of two Social Media 'champions' in the staff group has led to greater awareness of social media and its actual and/or potential impact on the children and families, involved with the YOS. Information is dissemination via a standing item at Team Meetings. Questions about social media use have been incorporated into our assessment process. The champions have developed sessions on 'on-line' safety for colleagues to use with children and parents. We have guidance for the practitioners. An e-safety newsletter, produced by Police, is circulated to YOS staff. We have obtained leaflets for parents. And we receive newsletters and updates from other relevant sources such as Child Exploitation & Online Protection (NCA), Saferinternet.org, NSPCC, and Netaware. 

1.7	Targets for 2018-19:
* Participate in Early Help Review - Workstream 2 Adolescent Offer (Ongoing).
* Attempt to reintroduce an NHSE Health and Justice Collaborative Commissioning project in partnership with AWP (Completed).
* Implement all relevant recommendations from HMI Probation Thematic Inspections in 2018/19 and any outstanding from 2017/18 including the thematic on Out of Court Disposals in which we participated (Completed).
* For all case managers to work in a more trauma informed way with children, young people and families (Partially completed - ongoing).
* Practice Leads in Signs of Safety to review and develop practice within the YOT to adopt a more Signs of Safety model to meetings and reports (Completed). 
* For all practitioners to have the confidence to have meaningful conversations about emotional well-being with children, young people and families and have the skills to enable them to make positive changes (Partially completed - ongoing).
* For the senior practitioner to contribute to the delivery of Connect 5 training across the Local Authority (Completed).
* Appoint a 'champion' of social media within the YOS, who will ensure the YOS is up-to-date with the latest trends in on-line technology and its various roles in affecting, positively and negatively, the lives of children (Completed).
* To add 'social media' to the assessment process (Completed).
* To increase the use of IT as a way of communicating with children and families (getting email addresses and mobiles of children & their parents) (Partially completed - ongoing).


1.8 	Innovative or promising practice:
* April 2019 roll out of the new YADD (Youth Alcohol and Drug Diversion scheme). This is force wide (Avon and Somerset) and replaces the Drug Diversion Programme (specific to SGYOT) and Drug Education Programme ensuring consistency across the region.
* Imminent commencement of the Trauma Recovery Model/ Enhanced Case Management pilot across the South West.
* The availability of a Speech & Language Therapist, even if only for a day per week, has enhanced the quality of assessments and assisted in the understanding of some children and how best to communicate and work with them. Speech & Language assessments have assisted other agencies including the police and the courts.
* YOT's work with children involved in harmful sexual behaviour (HSB) has further developed. Specialist trained YOT staff are involved with young people at the earliest stage to support safety planning (home, school and community) and to begin engaging with the YP, and look at offering YOT wide support services at an early stage (drug and alcohol service, speech and language service, educational input). At an appropriate time YOT staff can commence a specialist assessment and recommend if required a tailored intervention programme. All work in this area is joint worked (sometimes with the Social Worker). All specialist YOT staff have regular specialist case consultation with an experienced clinician (in addition to YOT supervision).
* A regular monthly HSB risk meeting chaired by the YOT Operations Manager. Allows close monitoring and oversight of this increasing area of work. In addition the HSB Specialist provides monthly peer support sessions as well as ongoing consultation support to the other specialist staff.
* A member of staff has developed a specific programme aimed at boys. Called 'ManKind', the programme is a cognitive programme that tackles the negative male stereotypes and is structured to stimulate discussion. The identified need of the programme was an observation that there could be a need and/or a different approach to your typical 'anger management' type programmes.  This programme is a resource that we use with boys around male role/s in society. ManKind sources much of its material from the internet and social media which is familiar to the boys. Boys suitable for the programme are identified by their case worker, because they have shown thoughts and feelings/belief around toxic masculinity e.g. "you have to be violent and aggressive to sort problems out as a male!". The objectives for the young person is to broaden their perspective, to listen and challenge the educator as well as their own views. 
* The introduction of two Social Media 'champions' in the staff group has led to greater awareness of social media and its actual and/or potential impact on the children and families, involved with the YOS. Information is disseminated via a standing item at Team Meetings. Questions about social media use have been incorporated into our assessment process. The champions have developed sessions on 'on-line' safety for colleagues to use with children and parents. We have guidance for the practitioners. An e-safety newsletter, produced by Police, is circulated to YOS staff. We have obtained leaflets for parents. And we receive newsletters and updates from other relevant sources such as Child Exploitation & Online Protection (NCA), Saferinternet.org, NSPCC, and Netaware. 

1.9	Targets for 2019-20:
* Trauma Recovery Model/ Enhanced Case Management (TRM/ECM) - identifying appropriate YP and working more intensely and with support and consultation from the TRM team.
* Prepare for HMI of Probation inspection under the new inspection regime.
* The new 'Standards for children in the youth justice system 2019' are implemented this year. A self-assessment will be required by the end of the year (April 2020 - commencing September 2019) in order to baseline our adherence to the new standards. Any gaps in adherence will then be included in the targets of next year's Youth Justice Plan and thereafter. 
* Victim services will be reviewed in light of various Inspection reports to consider more input from the victim liaison worker in decision making (for instance as a standing member of the Caution Panel) and to encourage victim participation. 
* Support the development of the new Early Help Strategy and the development of a targeted adolescent team.
* Supporting and managing the possible end of Troubled Families Initiative (TFI) funded Early Intervention posts in the YOS and the impact on the Out of Court Disposals (OoCD) and Early Intervention work of the YOS.
* To continue in our efforts for all practitioners to have the confidence to have meaningful conversations about emotional well-being with children, young people and families and have the skills to enable them to make positive changes.
* To continue aiming to increase the use of IT as a way of communicating with children and families (getting email addresses and mobiles of children & their parents).
* To continue to respond to all HMI of Probation Thematic Inspections reports with a self-assessment against the report's Recommendations and an Improvement Plan overseen by the Youth Justice Partnership.

Youth Offending Service Funding 2010-2020
* includes estimated cost of police officer salary and/or cost of accommodating YOS in Police property
# PCC funding used to come from the YJB
** Government required an additional in-year saving of £25k increasing a 7.6% into a 17.4% annual for 2015/16
## National Probation Service no longer making cash contribution only staff (plus £5000 support costs per worker)

As the above table highlights, there has been a significant reduction in funding for the YOS since 2010/11, much of this reduction comes from the YJB (52% over 10yrs).  In real terms this represents a much greater reduction.  These reductions have been accommodated by reductions in both staffing and resources.
Continued satisfactory performance against the three key national indicators would indicate that funding and resourcing is at a sufficient level. 



3.2 Funding for 2019/20

* Funding from all partners will remain the same (except for agency increases in salaries) for 2019-20.
* The YJB Youth Justice Grant has been reduced by .94%. This represents £1805 in cash terms.
* Funding not included in the table above but critical to the reduction of crime/reoffending is the jointly funded Troubled Families Initiative/YOS Early Intervention Project introduced in the YOS in mid-2013/14 (see Appendix 1).  The TFI funding is due to end in March 2020. 
* The YOS continues to benefit from funding from the NHS England Health & Justice Fund. This provides for an additional 0.5 Primary Mental Health Specialist and a day per week Speech & Language Therapist. This funding ends March 2020.

* There is more funding detail at Appendix 1
* There is a diagram of the staffing structure of the YOS including which agency/grant funds which post, at Appendix 3
4. Structures and governance 
Outcome:
Integrated strategic planning and working with clear performance oversight to ensure effective delivery of youth justice services. 

4.1 South Gloucestershire YOS is managed through a Management Board which meets quarterly. All statutory partners (LA, Police, Probation & Health) are represented at senior level. Other key agencies are also represented including Community Safety and Youth Court. 

4.2 Specifically the Youth Justice Partnership is responsible for:
* Overseeing the production of the annual Youth Justice Plan including the establishment of performance targets.
* Monitoring the performance of the YOS, identifying and receiving reports on areas needing particular focus for improvement.
* Ensuring statutory functions of respective agencies in relation to the YOS are met.
* Ensuring resource issues are identified and solutions agreed
* Ensuring all partners are aware of emerging national and local developments in relation to YOS, addressing any implications of these for both the YOS and individual agencies.
* Reporting issues of relevance to the Safer & Stronger Strategic Partnership and Children, Young People and Families' Partnership Board.

4.3 During 2019/20 the Management Board will continue to review and refine if necessary, its focus and purpose to become better informed and more proactive in pursuit of the three key youth justice outcomes:
* Reducing the number of first-time entrants (FTEs) to the youth justice system.

* Reducing reoffending

* Reducing custody numbers.
4.4 The line management of South Gloucestershire YOS is through the Children, Adults and Health Department (established in January 2013).  This enables the YOS to have strategic and operational roles in both the Criminal Justice and Child Welfare systems. The YOS reports to both South Gloucestershire Safer and Stronger Communities Strategic Partnership and to South Gloucestershire Children, Young People and Families Partnership.
4.5 There is YOS reporting structure at Appendix 2
5. Partnership arrangements

Outcome:
Effective partnership arrangements are in place between YOS statutory partners and other local partners that have a stake in delivering local youth justice services, and these arrangements generate effective outcomes for children and young people who offend or are at risk of offending.  


5.1 All relevant partners from both Children's Services and Criminal Justice are represented on the Youth Justice Partnership.  In turn the YJ Partnership is represented on both the Safer and Stronger Strategic Partnership and Children, Young People and Families Partnership. 

5.2 The YOS has links to all key partners through a variety of strategic and operational groups:

* The YOS is a statutory member of the Local Safeguarding Children's Board, playing a full part in that process and involved in the development of the new safeguarding arrangements.
* The YOS Operations Manager is a member of the LSCB Child Exploitation and Missing Sub-Group. This involves participation in regular multi-agency Exploitation case audits. 
* The YOS Operations Manager attends a monthly multi-agency exploitation forum.
* The YOS Operations Manager attends the fortnightly meeting with the Police Operation Topaz (Police Child Exploitation Team).
* The YOS is a member of the South Gloucestershire Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) partnership group.
* Avon & Somerset Probation/National Probation Service, Avon & Somerset Police and the Police & Crime Commissioner hold regular meetings with the 5 YOSs in that area.  
* The YOS attends the meetings of the Avon and Somerset Bench Youth Panel meetings of magistrates, keeping them informed of trends and issues in youth justice along with the YOSs for Bristol, BANES, Somerset and North Somerset.  
* The YOS is an integral part of the local arrangements for responding to anti-social behaviour.  
* The YOS is represented on the Avon and Somerset Criminal Justice Board and there are mechanisms in place to allow the five YOSs in Avon and Somerset to play a full and meaningful role in the work of that body. This includes South Gloucestershire Council being a signatory to the A&S LCJB Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). 
* The YOS is represented on the A&S MAPPA Strategic Management Board.  
* At a more local level the YOS has referred cases to the Multi-Agency Public Protection Panel for guidance.  
* The YOS is also a member of the Domestic Violence Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference (DV MARAC). 
* The YOS is a member of the Children & Young People's Mental Health Strategy Group and the Anti-social Referral Panel.
* The YOS is a key member of the Troubled Families (Families in Focus) Project Board and the operational and delivery groups which serve this board.
* The YOS is a member of the Prevent Board.
* The YOS is a member of the Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny Panel
* The YOS is invited to all Child Protection Strategy Meetings involving young people who are displaying harmful sexual behaviour (the YOS has skills in assessment and intervention in this area and can work with children and young people both in and outside the Youth Justice System). 
* The YOS is a member of the Be-Safe/ Stay Safe Children's Programme Partnership/ Steering Group Meeting. Be-Safe is a multi-agency partnership working with children and young people with problematic/ harmful sexual behaviour in Bristol/ South Gloucestershire.
* The YOS is a member of the Youth Housing Strategy Group.
* The YOS has a Memorandum of Understanding with Lighthouse, the Police & Crime Commissioner funded support project for the victims of crime.
* The YOS has a Service Level Agreement with Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI) to provide support to the victims and perpetrators of hate crimes all kinds and training for YOS staff.
* The YOS undertakes services for Missing Children including the completion of Return Home Interviews.
* The YOS is a member of the SW Resettlement Consortium and has been a partner in the development of the SW TRM/ECM pilot which is overseen in this meeting.

6. Risks to future delivery
Outcome:
The YOS has the capacity and capability to deliver effective youth justice services.

6.1 As stated in previous Plans, the YOS has not been exempt from the impact of austerity (as the budget table at Section 3 highlights). Further reductions in funding and resourcing contributions from partners or the YJB can only be accommodated by the further loss of posts and therefore capacity and quality in service. It will be for the Youth Justice Partnership to ensure that the 'risks' identified in this section are managed appropriately both through the YOS and the agency which they represent.
6.2 All of the YJB Good Practice Grant funds staff posts involved in the provision of statutory youth justice services (see Appendix 3), so any reduction in this grant will mean a direct and immediate reduction in staff. This will have a negative impact of the level and quality of the services provided by the YOS.
6.3 The ending of the Troubled Families' Initiative funding in March 2020 will most certainly impact on the YOS's capacity to continue to provide the level and quality of early intervention work within the Out of Court Disposal cohort. TFI Funding provides for two Early Intervention Worker posts. Without an alternative source of funding to cover the TFI funding from April 2020, the workers in these posts are likely to seek alternative employment, before March 2020. It is unlikely that we will be able to fill the two short term vacancies. This will mean that some of the intense and successful work we do with children and families identified at the 'community resolution' stage may no longer happen. 
6.4 There are elections for a new Police & Crime Commissioner in May 2020 which may change the direction, expectations, and support of the PCCO.  This means that 2019/20 is the last year of the Police and Crime Grant (which is where the SSCSP funding comes from to fund the YOS's Substance Misuse Service) so there's extra uncertainty over that from April 2020 onwards.  
6.5 The YOS continues to benefit from funding from the NHS England Health & Justice Fund. This provides for an additional 0.5 Primary Mental Health Specialist and a day per week Speech & Language Therapist. This funding ends in March 2020. As with the ending of the TFI funding and the grant from the PCCO, this could add up to a significant loss in funding and resources.
6.6	It is important that any changes in services for older children, introduced following the conclusions of the Early Help Review, do not impact adversely on the statutory business of the YOS. The gradual movement of 'child offending behaviour' away from being considered a solely criminal justice matter, to being considered a possible risk factor or indicator of wider concerns, to be addressed through non-criminal justice, children and family services, is very welcome. This shift is being reflected in the development of new local arrangements for supporting older children.  The YOS or the roles and responsibilities of the YOS, are being integrated into these new structures. Within these new structures, YOSs are being given broader remits for other children at risk. This not only includes the Out-of-Court disposals cohort referred to the YOS. It includes children involved in harmful sexual behaviour, children going missing, children at risk of criminal and/or sexual exploitation and other children in crisis. It is critical that with these broader responsibilities come the resources to adequately support the target group. 
6.7 South Gloucestershire has high school exclusion rates. Alongside this form of 'off-rolling', the YOS has experience of schools persuading reluctant parents to 'home educate' their children as a way of removing them from the school roll. There is also evidence that some schools in South Gloucestershire are involved in refusing children access to the school, without providing an alternative provision. The risks associated with exclusion are well evidenced nationally. Excluded children and children not attending school are at significantly greater risk of criminal and sexual exploitation. This includes risk to being groomed for gang-membership, and involvement in knife crime and 'county lines'.
6.8 The increased risk of radicalisation of young people, although not a significant problem within South Gloucestershire at the present times, nevertheless requires the YOS and its staff to be ever vigilant to the risk posed to a small number of children who maybe be vulnerable either when in custody or in the community. All staff have received the Government's Prevent training (WRAP). 
6.9 Neither is knife crime a significant problem in South Gloucestershire. In the few cases we have, they tend to be 'possession' cases unrelated to 'gang' or 'county lines' issues prevalent in other areas. However, we do share a boundary with Bristol City so workers need to be alert to the risks of gang and county lines involvement. This is particularly the case with those children who have a history of going missing on a regular basis and who are vulnerable to being drawn into involvement in sexual and/or criminal exploitation, gangs or county lines. 
6.10 It will continue to be important to monitor the impact of austerity on other services for families, children and young people, both universal and specialist, and if it affects levels of youth crime and anti-social behaviour.  There may also be adverse effects on other key associated problematic areas like substance misuse, mental health and emotional well-being, Education, Employment and Training issues, teenage pregnancy and children going missing.   
6.11 The incidence of harmful sexual behaviour, involving children in the youth justice system and out-of-court, continues to grow and continues to utilise a significant portion of the YOS resource. Any reduction in funding could impact adversely on our important work in this area. 
If there is a reversal in the present direction of travel which is seeing a reduction in youth crime and the numbers of young people formally processed by the youth justice system, this may have implications wider than the capacity of the YOS to deal with the inevitable increased workloads. 
The Youth Justice Partnership will assess the risk of these implications as part of the monitoring of service delivery and targets.
