Foreword



"St Helens Youth Justice Service has a statutory responsibility for the local co-ordination and delivery of youth justice services, working in partnership with police, the national probation service and health.  Over recent years good partnership working has overseen significant reductions in the numbers of young people entering the criminal justice system using restorative justice and other diversionary activities.  Not only has this reduced the criminalisation of young people, it has in most cases, better served the wider public as those young people have not tended to re-offend following diversionary or restorative intervention.

Consequently, St Helens YJS is now working with a smaller cohort of young people with a potentially more entrenched pattern of offending and a greater degree of complexity and risk, at both an individual and cohort level.  The service has re-shaped its offer to work more intensively with these young people with a view to reducing both the frequency and seriousness of their offending and in doing so, to reduce the use of custody, whilst at the same time seeking to reduce risk to the wider community.

The Strategic Youth Justice Plan 2019 - 20 outlines the continuing shift in focus as the service seeks to respond to changes in the service user profile, continuing funding reductions and the implications of the recent changes within the directorate. In broad terms, the service will need to ensure it strikes an appropriate balance between child welfare and safeguarding concerns and the sharper edge of reducing reoffending and public protection. St Helens Youth Justice has directed a particular focus on diverting and preventing the unnecessary criminalisation of Looked After Children over the last 12 months and again, this continues to be a primary feature of the frontline work. The recent service restructure has accounted for this by the development and introduction of a specialist 'Children We Look After Champion' role whose primary aim is to work closely within the partnership to develop awareness of the unique challenges the children the Council looks after face and to improve collective responses to their behaviour, based on a trauma-informed approach. Indeed, a trauma informed foundation is at the heart of all that we deliver as a service.

Over recent years and in common with other public sector services, grant funding for St Helens YJS from the Youth Justice Board has reduced significantly, however, this year we have received similar to 2018/19, which is reassuring .  Given the service is now required to meet the costs of young people remanded to the secure estate with a fixed level of grant set against a potentially volatile cost profile, the service will need to continue to innovate and explore with partners new ways of working that meet strategic priorities without placing young people or the community at risk. The service has developed an integrative and more cohesive way of working within the local area and continued development of the local partnership that underpins St Helens YJS is also an integral part of the 2019/20 Plan, particularly in relation to how education and health practitioners contribute to reducing re-offending.  The new Head of Service has changed the direction of travel to help focus available resources on strengthening the prevention offer and developing community resilience at a local level in order to reduce First Time Entrants and in an effort to impact on the re-offending rates. 

A renewed focus on restorative practice and training across the specialist education provision and care homes is underway, along with a renewed focus on victim engagement using an RJ approach. It is envisaged that this will do much to strengthen a collaborative approach to reducing re-offending and the number of Looked After Children entering the service at a local level."


Councillor    - Jeannie Bell (Cabinet Member for Community Safety, St Helens Council).


1.	Introduction

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires Local Authorities to have a Youth Justice Plan (YJSP) to set out how youth justice services will be funded and delivered locally within the parameters created by available resources. This document sets out the plans and priorities of St Helens Youth Justice Service (SHYJSS) for the period from 2019-2020.  It will be reviewed annually to reflect the impact of changing national and local youth justice priorities and service user feedback.  It directly addresses the aim of the Youth Justice System (YJSS) to prevent offending by children and children (Crime and Disorder Act 1998).

SHYJSS is the sole statutory service in St Helens responsible for the co-ordination and delivery of youth justice services across the borough for children aged 10 - 18 years. Through working integratively and in partnership, the service aims to achieve the youth justice strategic objectives which are to:
The YJSS aims to ensure that:
* Children receive the support they need to lead crime-free lives and to contribute positively to society; 
* More children who offend are held to account for their actions and are supported via a trauma informed approach to reduce and ultimately stop offending; 
* Victims are better supported and 
* The public are protected. 
* The safety and welfare of children coming into the service is paramount.

St.Helens Council continues to grapple with the impact of significant cuts to public sector investment and ever growing demand for its services. As a council we are not unique in this position, and with pressures reaching critical limits across the whole of the local public service system, a new collaborative approach was recognised as being urgently required if the needs of the community are to continue to be met. In line with this and in recognition of the continuing pressures on budgets and resulting depleting resources, Merseyside local authorities, including St Helens have started to develop a range of options around closer collaboration, building upon the work already established and embedded with Greater Merseyside YOTs.  Progress with this alliance and future plans are set out later in this report.

Service Profile:

The St Helens Youth Justice Service is a multi-agency partnership that sits within the People's Services department of St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council.  The partnership comprises of statutory partners; the Local Authority, Merseyside Police, the National Probation Service and Health (St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group - CCG) each of whom have a duty placed upon them by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to secure youth justice services appropriate to their area. In addition, the partnership benefits from a wider involvement of other organisations.

Our primary service users are children and children in the criminal justice system, their families and victims of their crimes. We also work extensively on a preventative basis with children and families identified by ourselves and key partners as being at risk of entering the criminal justice system. Our key stakeholders include all communities in St Helens who are affected by the criminal and anti-social behaviour of children and children that we are trying to engage with and divert from the system. St Helens is committed to working in partnership with children and families. To that end, the voice and strengths of the extended communities within the Borough are central to everything that we do. 

The YJSS Partnership is a key contributor to the Children's Services agendas.  The Head of Service is a board member of the Merseyside Criminal Justice Board (MCJB), the Merseyside Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny panel, Chairs the Greater Merseyside Youth Offending Service (GMYOS) Heads of Service meetings, is vice-Chair for the newly created Child at Risk of Exploitation (CARE) sub group and is also LA Chair for CHANNEL (adults and children) panels as part of the PREVENT agenda. The YJSS plays a pivotal role to improving community safety, protecting the public and to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children within St Helens.  Indeed, it should be noted that in setting the context for this plan, the Council has recently been through significant localised changes, with the arrival of a new Strategic Director of Children's Services in June 2018. This has culminated in a change of cabinet portfolios and significant movement in Assistant Director responsibilities. As a result of political movement, Youth Justice has moved out of Children's Services and now sits within Community Safety. Consequently, the Head of Youth Justice has recently assumed new areas of responsibility alongside Youth Justice, including PREVENT and most recently, the Young Persons Drug & Alcohol Team (YPDAAT) in place of Education Welfare. It is anticipated that the management of YPDAAT alongside YJSS will serve to enhance the YJSS Improvement Plan given the majority of YJ children are open to this service. 

2.	The St Helens Vision

The St Helens Council Plan 2018 - 2020 sets out the vision for St Helens and the overall priorities for the borough. People are at the heart of the St Helens Vision, with an overall aim to 'work together' to improve lives and create a better living and working environment for residents and visitors via innovation. The St Helens Plan sets out the main areas of focus and activity against priorities that are realistic in the current era of austerity whilst accounting for the reduction in resources. The work of St Helens Youth Justice service is set out within this plan and is directly linked to the corporate priorities of 'Improving People's Lives' and 'Improving Place' with the aim of reducing overall levels of crime and anti-social behaviour in line with the local Community Safety Partnership and localised Education and Health targets.  The new Head of Service has worked hard to revive the service in line with the Council's vision of innovation and creativity by encouraging the service to better integrate with the local community in which it is based and by endeavouring to try new cohesive and creative approaches to partnership working in an effort to engage with children and families in order to support them and enable them to lead law abiding lives. Within the St Helens Plan, one of the focal points for action is: 'Fewer children becoming involved in the criminal justice system.' This plan is designed to be key to supporting successful delivery of this priority.

St Helens Youth Justice Service is committed to working in partnership to ensure:

* Children are appropriately diverted from the YJSS
* That offending by children and children is prevented
* The delivery of quality and effective services to children, parents/carers, victims and partner agencies
* The improvement of practice and achievement of positive outcomes for service users
* That children are safeguarded and risk to the public is minimised and managed effectively
* That the service provides value for money
* That restorative justice and a trauma-informed approach underpins our practice
* The un-necessary criminalisation of Looked After Children is avoided where at all possible
* Improving Education and Employment opportunities for children within the service
* Improving the physical health and wellbeing offer to all children entering YJS & Young People's Drug and Alcohol Team (YPDAAT)

In order to do so effectively, the partnership must ensure that the local offer sufficiently meets the needs of the children, parents/carers and victims engaged with St Helens Youth Justice.

Significantly, national Youth Justice data indicates a sustained and positive reduction in the number of children entering Youth Justice for the first time. This is reflected at a local level in St Helens in the most recent performance data highlighted in appendix 5 of this report.  Somewhat invariably however, the focus on diversion and prevention also brings with it the recognition that those children who do remain in the Youth Justice service are often the most vulnerable children with multiple complex needs. Many of these children are entrenched in a cycle of offending and often present the greatest risk to the public and subsequently the biggest challenges to the professionals responsible for their supervision and care.  Indeed, no single agency has the resources or expertise to improve outcomes and desistance for these children single-handedly; it is therefore vital that a partnership approach based on integration and innovation to tackling youth crime remains at the heart of this plan.

3.	St Helens YJS - Key Achievements for 2018/19:

Those below in italics were outstanding for completion in last years business plan and have since been accomplished in 2018/19.

* Continued reduction in FTE  
* Continued reduction in the use of Custody 
* Use of the YJB reoffending toolkit has evidenced that currently we have improved our reoffending rate at a local level to around 27%.
* Development & maintenance of a Youth Integrated Offender Management (IOM) cohort
* Completion of a Review of the Children's Social Care and Youth Justice Service Protocol
* Inspection Readiness Quality Assurance Audits regularly underway on a quarterly basis within the service
* Rollout of Trauma- informed approaches training to all staff
* Recruitment of a new Operational Manager in February 2018
* Recruitment of a new Head of Service in April 2018
* Whole service restructure currently underway which includes the creation of new posts and several re-designated roles, including a part time Educational Psychologist, Victim Worker, Volunteer/mentoring Coordinator & LAC Champion role to reflect service need based on current data
* OOCD panel has been revised to include a volunteer representative of the local community
* Prevention referrals scheme operating at full capacity
* Introduction of Resettlement Panels for children coming out of custody.
* Successful bid for in-house CAMHS provision submitted on behalf of NHS England to provide 3 days a week dedicated YJS provision to children, delivered by Barnados. 
* The confirmed maintenance of the Restorative Services Quality Mark. 
* Delivery of RJ training to local care homes, YJSS staff, sessional workers and Volunteers by the service which is ongoing.
* Delivery of AA training & 10-point plan awareness to care-homes, commissioning and Police at a local level
* Increase in delivery of direct reparation to victims where deemed appropriate.
* The service has now gone paperless and all staff have been supported to do agile working and received surface pros & new mobile phones. The office has also been given wifi provision in all areas and ipads have been obtained in order that better online interventions can be done with children with a range of varying needs.
* Development of a new YP forum to ensure the VOC is considered in all we do.
* Developed links with victim service within the Liverpool city region, including those commissioned by the PCC.
* YJSS have created a revised strapline & building signage in conjunction with the children represented at the new YP forum
* YJSS continue to have a voice on key strategic partnerships including I-thrive, Level 2 panels, (Multi-Agency Child Exploitation Meetings (MACE)
* Embedded knife-crime interventions - both awareness raising and targeted interventions for all children open to the service.
* Achievement of the SEND Quality Lead Mark for the service for improving outcomes for our SEN population.
* Successful delivery of the 'Less is More' Approach to Asset plus assessments commissioned by the YJB to all 151 YOTS nationwide. This was delivered by the Head of Service and an Operational Manager and we received excellent feedback for this as a service.

Although there has been some significant changes within the Service here in St Helens in relation to staffing and roles and responsibilities and indeed across the directorate; 2018/19 has been largely successful in terms of annual outturn performance against the 3 national indicators, culminating in the Service achieving the SEND standards Quality Lead Mark (AYM) in recognition of the high quality outcomes within the service for children with special educational needs. Our biggest challenge as a service continues to be reoffending and this is something which the new Head of Service has focussed on improving since coming into post. We have introduced the local reoffending tracker tool to better assess our progress in this area and pleasingly, after a year of data throughput we are able to evidence that our reoffending is reducing at a local level, albeit the national data indicates that this continues to pose a significant challenge for us. A full list of our achievements as a service to date over the last year can be viewed on the YJS Story board on Appendix 1

4. Resources and Value for Money

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 not only places a duty upon the statutory partners to co-operate in securing appropriate youth justice services, it also creates a power to enable partners to fund youth justice services.

Over recent years, resources available to St Helens Youth Justice have reduced. Funding for St Helens Youth Justice in 2018/2019 is made up of contributions from the statutory partners, the YJB Good Practice Grant and a contribution from the Police and Crime Commissioners (PCC) Community Safety Fund (Appendix 2). Contributions are reviewed annually and during the period covered by this plan it is likely that all agencies will be exploring opportunities to make further savings.  This holds risks for the St Helens Youth Justice Partnership and there is likely to be increased pressure to demonstrate value for money as a result. Cash contributions from partners have remained static for the most part with a small increase in the YJB Good Practice Grant and an increase from the LA, which is positive. 

The YJSB Good Practice Grant is allocated to YOTs to develop good practice and commission research, with a view to achieving a reduction in youth re-offending, a reduction in first time entrants and a reduction in the use of youth custody.  The terms and conditions for receiving this set out clearly how this grant may be used and include a requirement for Heads of Service to include within the annual Youth Justice Plan, details of how they propose to use this funding to develop good practice, fulfil the requirements of the grant and provide overall assurance that the grant will be used exclusively for the delivery of youth justice services within the local area. Since 1st April 2015 St Helens YJSS has also accepted the transfer of the St Helens Junior Attendance Centre, which has been transferred to the Local Authority with funding to cover the associated running costs. 

The YJSS also monitors the use of the Local Authority's budget provided to meet the costs of children remanded to the secure estate, transferred under the provisions of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offender (LASPO) Act 2012.  This budget is reviewed annually by the YJSB based on a review of the use of remands over the previous three-year period.  The allocation received by St Helens Local Authority in 2018/19 was £4255 which did support demand as there were no children remanded to Youth Detention Accommodation (YDA) in 2018/19.  
The confirmed amount received for this financial year is £5659, which would pose a significant challenge for the service were a child to be remanded, in light of the bed night costs per establishment. For example, it is currently £579 for one night in a Secure Children's Home (SCH), £536 for one night in a Secure Training Centre (STC) and £191 per night in a Young Offenders Institution (YOI). Were we to have a situation in which several young people were remanded for an offence together, this could cause significant financial pressures for the service and the wider Integrated People's Services Department.

Although Local Authorities are responsible for meeting remand costs, the YJB holds the statutory responsibility for the commissioning of beds and for the placement of children within the secure estate. There are no YJS commissioned secure placements within the borough of St Helens.  Beds for children at Hindley Young Offender Institute (YOI) have been decommissioned and therefore St Helens children remanded or sentenced to custody are placed out of area, often a significant distance from their homes. This has a subsequent impact on service resources and the child's ability to maintain regular contact with family or set up realistic resettlement plans in relation to release on temporary licence (ROTL) to access Education, Training or Employment for post-custody supervision. In terms of their wellbeing, this also increases their vulnerability and propensity to suffer emotionally given their geographical isolation. 

4.1	Composition of St Helens Youth Justice Service

St Helens Youth Justice Service provides the main supervisory elements of statutory youth justice services as follows:

* assessment of children who have offended and management of risk and safeguarding issues
* supervision of children who have been remanded to custody and those requiring support in the community, as directed by the court
* provision of pre-court interventions
* supervision of children who have been given court orders which are to be managed in the community, including the provision of a lay youth panel to discharge the responsibilities of Referral Orders
* Sentence planning for children in custody and their supervision on release
* Provision of Pre-Sentence Reports to inform sentencing in Magistrates and Crown Court
* Recommendations of robust bail provision as a credible alternative to custody or remand

All Youth Justice Services must be made up of nominated and seconded staff from the statutory partners. Providing dedicated staff with knowledge of their host agencies to the Service helps to support the ethos of integration which is a key priority identified in the corporate business plan and supports multi-agency working. 

4.2	Statutory minimum staffing requirements

Section 39 (5) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 states that YOTs must include at least one of each of the following:

* an officer of a Local Probation Board or an officer of a provider of probation services
* where the local authority is in England, a person with experience of social work in relation to children, nominated by the director of children's services 
* a police officer 
* a person nominated by a clinical commissioning group or a local health board, any part of whose area lies within the local authority's area
* Where the local authority is in England, a person with experience in education, nominated by the director of children's services.

St Helens Youth Justice Service has historically benefited from a full-time seconded Probation Officer and Police Officer. However, due to a reduction in partner contributions, the Probation Officer post has reduced to 0.5 of a post.  HHThe Service directly employs 2 Social Workers to fulfil the Social Work requirement.  There have been some identified gaps in the education and health resource within the service this year and work to develop both areas commenced in 2018 with agreements reached for a 0.6 FTE School Nurse and a FTE seconded Education Welfare Officer, who is based here until April 2020.  The Youth Justice service in St Helens have also successfully secured monies via a bid offered by NHS England for a dedicated mental health professional commissioned by Barnardos, who are based 3 days a week in the YJS service to support children in relation to their emotional wellbeing. This is working well and significantly contributes to supporting desistance in the children we work with and helps support one of the principal aims of youth justice, namely building resilience with a view to reducing reoffending. 

The YJS Partnership recognises that there is further work required in the area of Health and this is a challenge which has recently been referred to the YJS Partnership Board. Public Health are currently leading on the implementation of a YJS Health Action Plan and reviewing current provision, examining the needs of the children open to the YJSS and mapping pathways. Unfortunately, both Youth Justice & YPDAAT have been unable to secure a consistent physical health offer for the children open to these services for some time given problems in relation to availability of nurses to dedicate time to the services on site and to provide the full range of physical health assessments the YJS and YPDAAT previously benefited from. A plan is currently being explored to remedy this and find a solution.

Suitable education or employment provision for post 16 children within the service has also been identified as a key priority for remedying this year. Around 25% of the current caseload are NEET with around 20% of these being 17 years of age plus. The Head of Service has tasked the lead Operational Manager for Education with setting up a monthly drop in with Careers Connect in order to try and target and support these young people with accessing appropriate ETE opportunities. These were established in June 2019 and the Head of Service has put this on quarterly reports moving forward for monitoring by the Partnership Board. Both of these areas have also been added to the service's priority plan for 2019/20.
 
The YJSS is made up of 4 additional case managers. The recent restructure based on a full review of service need by the Head of Service includes the removal of a layer of management (2 Senior Practitioners), in favour of introducing specialist roles which better serve the needs of the children & families we work with and identified by the current data. This includes a part time Educational Psychologist within the service which is currently being advertised and is vacant. Two YJ Officer posts have also been re-designated to 2 specialist roles, namely a LAC Champion and a Restorative Justice & Victim Liaison Coordinator whom are already in post. Two full time intervention officer posts have been deleted and replaced by a Reparation & Unpaid Work Coordinator, an Intervention Development Officer and a Volunteer Coordinator - posts that are currently being recruited to by the service. The Service also benefits from co-location with the Childrens Drug and Alcohol Team for which the Head of Youth Justice recently also assumed responsibility as part of their remit in place of Education Welfare.  A full-service structure can be seen at Appendix 3




5	Governance, Inspection and Partnership Arrangements  	

5.1 Governance

Integrated People's Services was formally created on 1 June 2018 when the Strategic Director role of the former People's Services Department became a joint role with the Accountable Officer of the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).  Integrated People's Services brings together Adult Services, Children's Services (including education and health), Public Health and the Clinical Commissioning Group.  The Strategic Director/Accountable Officer of the CCG fulfils the 5 statutory roles of Director of Children's Services.  As outlined earlier in this report, a newly appointed DCS took up post on 4 June 2018.

Integrated People's Services brings together all key services which aim to meet the needs and promote outcomes for all residents in the Borough and includes the following functions:

* Adult Social Care;
* Children's Social Care;
* Public Health;
* Integrated Adult Commissioning;
* Education and Children's Health;
* Integrated Adult Safeguarding:
* Integrated Children's Safeguarding;
* Contact Cares; 
* Quality/Patient Safety and Primary Care; and 
* Finance, Performance, Contracts and Estates.

Responsibility for the Youth Justice Service sits under the Community Safety Portfolio.  The YJS Head of Service role has also recently changed to include responsibility for the Young Person's Drug and Alcohol Team (YPDAAT) and PREVENT.

A People's Board has been established in St Helens to bring together the statutory responsibilities of both the Health and Wellbeing Board and the Community Safety Partnership under one Board to integrate working arrangements under a single structure to maximise effectiveness of the partnership.  Members of the People's Board have a statutory responsibility to work together to:

* Reduce offending;
* Tackle crime and disorder
* Tackle alcohol and substance misuse
* Tackle any other behaviour which has a negative effect on the local environment; and
* Undertake strategic assessment of the above areas and develop local strategies to address these issues.  

The vision and purpose of the People's Board is to:

"Improve people's lives in St Helens, together, by tackling the challenge of cost and demand".

This move to a wider partnership model encourages greater effective joint working, integration and the delivery of benefits for the people and communities of St Helens by supporting strategic planning and joint commissioning and provision of services across health, wellbeing, social care and community safety.   To help deliver the vision of the People's Board, a multi-agency operating model, St Helens Cares has been developed which has been nationally recognised.   This model will deliver an integrated local care system.

Revised governance arrangements to ensure the necessary improvements in the delivery of Children's Social Care are delivered, sustained and maintained have been introduced through a newly created Children's Improvement Board which has overarching responsibility for ensuring the safe and effective implementation of the proposals.

St Helens Youth Justice Service is governed by the YJS Partnership Board, emphasising the significance of partnership engagement and cooperation in the delivery of youth justice services.  The Partnership Board meets quarterly and is chaired by the Senior Assistant Director for Housing, Safer Communities, Recreation and Libraries.  There is representation on the Board from Merseyside Police, the National Probation Service, St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group, Community Safety, Public Health, Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service and Education.  A full breakdown of the membership of the Board can be found at Appendix 4.  In order to provide effective challenge and scrutiny, the YJSS Partnership Board receives quarterly reports on performance, updates on compliance with the YJSS Quality Assurance Framework, any Community Safeguarding or Public Protection Incidents and relevant information from the YJB.

Elected members will play a key role in the governance frameworks highlighted above and the Children's Improvement Board will work closely with other key boards and agencies including the St Helens Safeguarding Children's Partnership Board.  The St Helens YJSS Partnership Board continues to meet on a quarterly basis.  All Board members have received a full induction by the new Head of Service to ensure that all are sighted on the direction of travel and the key priorities we need to focus on in order to achieve the best outcomes for children and families we work with in St Helens.  As part of this, the Board members have created their own pledge as a sign of their commitment.  The Head of Service has worked hard to ensure that attendance is consistent from all partners and that the right people are present to support the service with its Improvement Plan for Inspection readiness.  

	
5.2	Inspection

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP) is an independent Inspectorate, funded by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), reporting directly to the Secretary of State on the efficacy of work with adults and children who have offended. A new programme for inspection of youth offending work was confirmed in March of 2018, 'Programme 18'.  The revised framework increases the frequency of inspections from Spring 2018. HMIP aim to inspect YOT's every 4 years and City YOT's every 2 years. A sample of cases inspected will now also include Out of Court disposal cases, which is unprecedented. All Inspections will now have judgement ratings on YJS Governance, Leadership and Partnership arrangements. More recently, HMIP communicated their intent to pilot a new framework at the end of 2019 for smaller YOTS. St Helens YJ would be one such potential service given its small size. There is no current information available as to what this framework will entail and how it will be different to the current model being rolled out. Once information is received, this will be shared across the partnership. 

The outcomes of inspections carried out by HMIP are well publicised and have a significant impact upon public and partner agency confidence. The HMIP inspection framework examines Youth Justice Services' ability to:

* Protect the public by managing the risk of serious harm to others
* Reduce the likelihood of re-offending 
* Protecting children and children who offend and reducing their vulnerability
* Support and enable children to complete their court sentences
* Have in place effective governance arrangements
* Deliver services in compliance with Home Office National Standards

Inspection of youth offending work under the current programme consists of 3 elements: 

* Organisational Delivery
* Court Disposals
* Out of Court Disposals

The last SQS inspection took place at St Helens YJS in June 2015 and it is vitally important that the Youth Justice Service, the Partnership Board and the wider Council are ready and prepared for any future inspection.  The last business plan highlighted that work had commenced to address issues regarding health and education support for children in contact with the YJSS.  The Short Quality Screening completed by HMIP in June 2015 also reinforced the need for improvement in the partnership work taking place within the service and identified as a key area for improvement was 'that the emotional health needs of children and children are clearly identified, assessed and met including the provision of specialist services'. As outlined earlier in this report, the YJSS have since secured 3 days a week dedicated in-house mental health provision delivered by Barnardos over a 3 year period. It is anticipated that this will significantly improve the emotional health response to our children in YJS and provide them with the specialist support that they need to desist from offending and improve their overall wellbeing. The impact of the service they provide is closely monitored by an Operational Manager who provides support for this secondee.

In 2016/17 the YJSS also jointly commissioned a Mentoring Programme with the local Troubled Families Initiative to work with those children at risk of re-offending, as part of our reducing re-offending action plan.  This was re-commissioned in 2017/18. This year, the recruitment of a full time Volunteer Co-ordinator post as part of the full-service restructure plan is anticipated to significantly contribute to the prevention of re-offending and support desistance in the children being supervised in St Helens YJSS. The impact of this post continues to be scrutinised via both the Troubled Families Board and Partnership Board and currently evidences a positive impact in terms of engaging some of our most troubled children. Unfortunately, the post holder resigned in May 2019 to take up a new position elsewhere and as a result, the post is currently vacant. 

The Management Team within St Helens YJS has been through significant change in the last year with the arrival of a new Head of Service in April 2018 and a new Operational Manager at the beginning of February 2018. The new Head of Service has focussed on ensuring inspection readiness by reviewing all aspects of the service and its delivery and this has culminated in a full-service restructure being implemented in line with local need. This was signed off by Chief Officers in June 2019 which means that the service is currently experiencing a challenging time in terms of uncertainty and there has been a dip in workforce morale as a result. The Management team are currently working hard to re-establish the team and cultivate a positive working culture within the service and consequently the embedding of this restructure has also been identified as a key priority for 2019/20.

Over the last year, the service has striven to provide a robust prevention offer to the children in St Helens with a view to keeping our most vulnerable children out of the CJS. We have also increased our integrative footprint at a local level, working closely with care homes and specialist SEN schools in order to support them in managing children using a trauma-informed approach to engagement. This has largely been well received and we have forged a strong local partnership with police, schools and care-homes as a result. The Board are updated regularly on inspection readiness and the service has an improvement plan which is regularly reviewed by the management team in order to ensure that direction of travel is monitored and is consistent. The Board has been inducted and a self-assessment process has been embedded supporting improvement and development and most recently applied to the introduction of the new National Standards. 

The YJS service introduced resettlement panels in 2018/19 to support robust multi-agency planning around children in custody for release into the community as part of a reducing re-offending action plan which we have implemented as part of the overall improvement plan for the service. (this can be viewed within the YJS storyboard in appendix 2 of this report). Re-engagement panels are a key contributor to this strategy and have been devised as a means of preventing children from breaching their Orders and preventing a return to Court where at all possible. When a child receives their second written warning for non-compliance they are invited in to a meeting with their parent or carer; in order to explore the reasons for non-compliance and to agree a bespoke contract suited to the child's individual needs in order to support and enable compliance.    These panels have recently been revised to ensure that Managers Chair these with case managers and the offer of childrens' warnings being wiped on successful completion, incorporated within these. 

An SCLN Clinic has also been set-up across the service. The clinic has been running successfully since June 2019, following the service purchasing a new 'Do it All' profiler assessment tool in March of the same year. This is used by BDA SCLN Champions who work within the YJS. The computerised tool is not a diagnosis but the Learning Difficulties and Disabilities (LDD) screening pack within it captures background information and screens for strengths and challenges in the areas of:

•	Functioning (Learning Disabilities)
•	Attention and Concentration
•	Organisation and Planning
•	Reading and writing
•	Social and Communication

The profiler will provide
•	Clear reports for young person and staff
•	Practical strategies designed to empower children and up-skilling staff. 

Case Managers can then modify their approach to make engagement more accessible, i.e expecting less written work, not requesting the child read aloud, and use digital interfaces with them where possible. Where written work is required then changing the colour of the paper used in interventions and how this is delivered is also adjusted.  
It is hoped that this will further support the ever-increasing cohort of children within the service with special educational needs (SEN). The outcomes and efficacy of this tool will be closely monitored going forward and updates provided to the Partnership Board by the Champions.

5.3 	Partnership

The YJSS works in partnership with criminal justice services, community safety partnership, services for children and children and health.  Priorities of the St Helens YJSS are reflective of the objectives of our partner agencies and align with the priorities of the MCJB, the Merseyside PCC's, Police and Crime Plan, the Peoples Plan and the Health and Wellbeing Strategy. The recently appointed Strategic Director of Children's Services is keen to improve integration of service to deliver improved outcomes across the continuum of need in relation to Health, Education and Social Care; therefore partnership working is at the centre of the Council's approach and further strengthens the YJ approach.

The YJSS engagement within these various forums and partnerships provides key opportunities to ensure that the needs of children at risk of or involved in offending behaviour are highlighted and can therefore be considered and reflected within the development of local priorities and plans.

Within Merseyside, there are five metropolitan boroughs and each has a YJSS.  The Head of each YJSS along with the Head of Cheshire West, Halton and Warrington YJSS form the Greater Merseyside Youth Justice Strategic Leads Collaboration.  The YJSS Heads of Service meet on a bi-monthly basis and aim to:

* Promote value in all YJSS functions and resource management
* Use strategic intelligence in order to develop an informed and collaborative approach to improve effectiveness and practice across Greater Merseyside 
* Promote effectiveness regarding safeguarding and public protection across Greater Merseyside 

This group along with the Youth Performance Improvement Group (YPIG) are key forums for collaboratively driving forward developments in youth justice practice with our partners across Greater Merseyside. St Helens Head of Service is the Chair of this meeting. Moreover, on a regional level, the Head of Service sits on the Merseyside Strategic IOM, is Vice-Chair for the newly introduced MACE meetings as part of the locally revised safeguarding arrangements and sits on the Out of Court Scrutiny Panel for Merseyside. The YJ Head of Service also has overall responsibility for the coordination and delivery of the combined Merseyside Youth Court. As the lead Senior Officer for PREVENT in the authority, the YJ Head of Service also chairs CHANNEL panels in relation to all children and adult referrals. This presents a significant added challenge for the Head of Service but also has provided a further opportunity to develop partnership links within Schools, health, the voluntary sector and with CT Policing in line with the council's.  On a local level, the YJSS is represented within several key partnerships and forums including the Integrated Offender Management (IOM) Operational Delivery Group and Children's Social Care Heads of Service & Operational Manager Meetings. The Director for Children and Children's Services and other YJSS stakeholders are members of the Health and Wellbeing Board and their representation allows for the reporting in of performance and health outcome measures.  The links between the YJSS Partnership Board and the Health and Well-Being Board will be used to support and drive forward the health developments within the YJSS. There is currently a significant drive by the new Head of Service to develop integrated working relationships with social care partners and to work together to apply and utilise a trauma-informed approach as a partnership to the assessment and intervention of the children and families we work with. The service has recently set up monthly operational management meetings between social care partners and YJS in order to ensure better communication and a uniform response to managing some of the services most vulnerable children.

YPDAAT coming under the remit of the YJ Head of Service provides a new opportunity for further integrative working between these services and allows for the joint targeting of some performance indicators in relation to health and wellbeing and the misuse of substances. The Team Manager & Senior Practitioner of YPDAAT are co-located with the YJ Managers and this also allows for better communication and a more joined up approach to our interventions. 

Part of the plan to strengthen this partnership includes the embedding by the YJS of bi-weekly risk briefings. This enables the efficient, swift and robust sharing of information and intelligence between St Helens YJS, Police and partners; establishing an agreed method to mitigate duplication and omission of important information and thereby reducing the need for ad-hoc requests. This is led by the YJS Police Officer with representatives from partners including YJS, Safer Communities, CSC (LAC and the 'Front Door' - this is the social care mechanism for screening and allocating all incoming social care referrals) and Housing etc. It comprises of a run through of the previous weeks Police briefing, highlighting any matters/local intelligence that is noteworthy for the partnership. A discussion around the YJS 'Top 10 Children of Concern' taken from the Children of Concern List (COCL) which is updated by the YJS.  Police are able to run a check to see if any children on the list have been recorded on the Police systems in the previous week - this includes arrests, suspects, stop and search, victims of crime or even intelligence reports with information of sightings, associates etc. An overview of St Helens children held in police custody over the weekend is also included and any cases involving inappropriate detention lengths flagged with the Head of Service. Moreover, the new Senior Assistant Director over Social Care has introduced bi-weekly high-risk tracker meetings for the partnership wherein all Heads of Service, including the Head of YJS review the children across the partnership who have been identified as the most at risk or vulnerable. 

Moreover, as the performance section of this report later shows, there is an identifiable group of YJ children within SEN Schools. In order to try and reduce First Time Entrants, LAC entering the CJS and in an effort to positively impact on reoffending rates, one of the Operational Managers has been tasked with steering a restorative approach in-house in conjunction with our seconded Police Officer. As outlined in the earlier sections of this report, it is envisaged that the newly re-designated roles of LAC Champion and Victim Liaison and Coordinator will help to strengthen the delivery of this model at a local level and promote the approach with local commissioning. Moreover, the introduction of an Educational Psychologist who can support a trauma-informed approach to supporting and enabling our SEN population will further develop our partnership working and strengthen our links within Education and Health. 

Over the last year we have also developed links with the voluntary sector including a Merseyside based initiative funded by the Big Lottery, called 'CELLS'. They are a group of people with individual experience of the criminal justice system, both as perpetrators and victims and they deliver group interventions or one to one mentoring for children on a preventative basis in local schools. They agreed to work with St Helens YJS as part our reducing re-offending action plan with 6 of our most 'at risk' of reoffending children, based on data supplied by our reoffending tool tracker. Group intervention has been a challenge for the service based on local childrens' reluctance to venture out of their individual locales. Despite the fact that St Helens is a small geographical area, the youth culture is such that going from one area into another is deemed too risky by many and there are territorial challenges to be faced if any do so. Inextricably linked to this are the patterns of offending manifest by the local children. Offences are often contained within the small area in which the child is resident and as a rule, the children coming into the service do not tend to go outside of this area at all. In terms of their supervision, this can translate into issues regarding a reluctance to attend interventions set away from the YJ office, or indeed in there - if this means venturing out of their local vicinity. Indeed, so pervasive is this local mindset that many children are also unwilling to go outside of St Helens at all for anything and so encouraging them to do so was one of the challenges the service set itself in order to develop their appreciation for what is on offer outside of the borough in terms of education, training and employment in particular. To this end, CELLS agreed to host their group intervention programme in Kirkby in Liverpool. This was very successful, to the extent that we are planning a second group to commence in the Summer of 2019 in collaboration with the partnership.

Integrative working in partnership with Early Help ensures that all of our new Prevention Referrals will now go through the Early Help Panel. Given this is a multi-agency platform; this will ensure that the children who are reviewed here will be offered the best service most suited to their particular need. 

6.	Performance 2019

The Youth Justice Board and the YJSS Partnership Board oversee performance of the service. The Head of Service reports performance on a quarterly basis to the Partnership Board and consults regularly with the YJSB's North West Business Area Local Partnership Advisor to identify and address key areas of performance and identified challenges.
In addition to the three National Indicators, reducing first time entrants into the criminal justice system, reducing the use of custody and reducing re-offending by children in the criminal justice system, St Helens YJSS also have local performance measures in place and reporting mechanisms for re-offending rates following prevention schemes, offending by looked after children and victim engagement and satisfaction. The Head of Service has also introduced a snapshot of performance in relation to the new national standards at every Board.


Reducing the Number of First Time Entrants to the Criminal Justice System

Since 2010/11 St Helens YJSS has seen reductions in the numbers of children becoming a first-time entrant to the YJSS.  This is largely attributable to the operation of the prevention initiative with Merseyside Police, which effectively diverts children from the criminal justice system and provides assessment and brief intervention.

9 children in St Helen's became a FTE to the youth justice system in Q4, bringing the total to 38 for the year 2018-19. This compares to 39 children in the previous year. Only one of these nine children is a female and one is a LAC of St Helens. Five of these young people had SEN, two have a diagnosis of ADHD. In line with the national picture, we are performing similarly at a local level here in St Helens. The Board will note that this years perfomance is not too dissimilar to last years, with a difference of only one between the 2 years in terms of numbers. Proportionally, it is evident that year on year the numbers are reducing overall and this is good. The graph below shows outcomes for this group of FTE year on year. Notably, there has been a significant rise in the number of children receiving a YCC - an increase of 9 on last years' figures.

St Helens Reoffending cohort's details (PNC data)
In July 2015 to June 2016 there were 142 young people of which 81 (57%) reoffended and they committed 311 further offences giving an average of 3.8 offences per young person who re-offended.
In July 2016 to June 2017 there were 129 young people of which 64 (49.6%) reoffended and they committed 243 further offences giving an average of 3.8 offences per young person who re-offended.

In the period 1/4/17 to 31/3/18 there were 73 St Helens young people who received a substantive outcome (i.e. Youth Caution and above). After tracking these for 12 months we can report the following.
Number in Cohort: 73
Number who re-offended: 20 (This equates to a local reoffending snapshot rate of 27%) NB: reoffending was only able to be reported on children under 18 years old. This is very encouraging and reflects the impact of the ongoing work being done by the service within the local community and across the partnership in relation to focussing efforts on those children committing the most re-offences.

In summary, the local data shows that the numbers of children going through the system overall are diminishing, the numbers being arrested are dropping and FTE's are declining. However, OOCD's are increasing. It would therefore be useful to look at the outcomes received for those in the re-offending tracker cohort in the next performance report, should this be able to be extrapolated. Furthermore, the service also plans to replicate this with CR's to track their efficacy over time. 

In last year's business plan the recent closure of the local custody suite was anticipated to have some level of impact on the number of children coming into the service. This hypothesis was evaluated in light of the below data:


Number of Children Arrested/Voluntary Interviewed




April 2018 - March 2019April 2017 - March 2018No of occurrences/arrests 567724No of young people271339Females53 (19.5%)72 (21.2%)Female LAC16 (30%)22 (30%)Males218267Male LAC55 (25%)78 (29%)Total LAC71 (26%)100 (29.5%)Offence typesViolence156 (27.5%)171 (23.6%)Criminal Damage103 (18%)125 (17%)Public Order62 (11%)117 (16%)Drugs87 (15%)90 (12%)Theft21 (3.7%)48 (6.6%)
Overall this data equates to a 22% drop in arrests/occurrences since the custody suite closed in March 2018 and YJS therefore had involvement with 20% less children as a result. It is pertinent to note that this has not impacted very much on the number of female LAC coming into the system however - they continue to be represented at the same level in terms of being arrested and interviewed. The increase in violent offending in this regard is also pertinent. We have seen an increase in the number of females entering the system for violent offences (an increase of 10% on last year). This is something that the service aims to address as part of its reducing reoffending action plan. One of the key tasks that will be given the newly appointed Interventions Development officer will be the targeted development of a programme of work designed specifically for girls to improve performance in this area.
In terms of arrests, the data shows that Public Order Offences and Theft related arrests have dropped in comparison to last year, however all others offence related arrests have risen. Why this is the case will require further evaluation with the partnership going forward. 
Notably, Possession of a knife went from 12 (1.6%) in 2017-18 up to 17 (3%) in 2018-19. Whether this reflects an increase in the number of children being prepared to carry / use these or whether there is an increase in these being detected is a debate that continues to develop at a local level. Certainly, St Helens YJ have put concerted efforts into targeting this concerning feature of localised offending in the area by developing intervention work at care homes, special schools and as part of all statutory court orders and prevention cases designed to reduce the prevalence of knife related offending. We have also commissioned the services of CELLS via the PCC's office who have successfully worked with some of our hardest to reach children on exactly this area of work as alluded to in the preceding section of this report. The programme we ran was successful to the extent that they were invited to attend the last Partnership Board to share the outcomes and engage the partnership in the work they are doing locally. St Helens YJ have a plan to run another group in the Summer of 2019 on a collaborative basis with partners including the police., social care and schools. The outcomes of these will be reported on in the plan for 2020/21. A full breakdown of the YJB Data Summary for April 2018 - March 2019 can be found in Appendix 5 of this report.

What we did not Achieve - 2018/19
       
The programme of work set out in the 2017/18 Youth Justice Plan was ambitious and there were certain priorities that were started but not fully achieved by the service. However. Those that were outstanding from the original 15 - 18 plans have since been achieved and are included in the list of achievements this year on pages... of this report. 
In 2018/19 we did not achieve the following:

* Referral order panel venues outside of the service - This has now been set up in partnership with the voluntary sector for the coming year.
* Physical Health offer 
*  L&D links still to be established for effective information sharing to safeguard children coming into police custody.
* Transition Offer - the Merseyside protocol is now in draft and awaiting agreement from NPS/CRC re victim input and custody transition, given OMIC introduction
* Standardised practice of the Court Team not fully embedded, albeit significant progress has been made since St Helens YJS took the lead on this piece of work across Merseyside.
* YJS Website improvements 
* Increased number of RJ conferences held with victims and children




7.	Priorities for 2019/20

The strategic priorities have been set for the YJS service based predominantly on the analysis of the previous years performance and emerging issues identified from this breakdown by the Head of Service. We have RAG rated ourselves as a service in line with HMIP's new inspection methodology in an effort to prioritise those areas which require the most attention.

8. Risks to future delivery against the youth justice outcome measures.

Reductions in the YJSS budget from the Youth Justice Board and statutory partners continue to threaten the delivery, quality and effectiveness of statutory youth justice services here in St Helens.  St Helens YJSS have managed to sustain the diversionary prevention offer for the Local Authority and have built on this over the last year and we now have a robust prevention offer which is full to capacity currently.  With increased resources there would be opportunities for the YJSS to expand its prevention offer beyond this. Given an identified need within some of our local schools and in relation to the Improvement plan priority around ETE and in reducing FTE and re-offending by our most vulnerable children, St Helens YJSS have developed and continued to deliver a plan to improve relationships, communication and prevention within those schools that house most of our children with an identified SEN. In partnership with the seconded Police Officer, we are continuing to develop work in this area with a view to reducing re-offending  & FTE's within these environments. It is anticipated that provided the proposed restructure is implemented, the LAC Champion Officer will focus 50% of their work time on developing training in house in schools and care homes in an effort to bolster our prevention offer and support vulnerable children from entering the criminal justice system.

As noted earlier in this plan, a full-service restructure has been agreed which supports those areas of priority evidenced by the local data. This was signed off by Chief Officers in the LA in June 2019 and a recruitment programme is now underway with the planned restructure due to be completed and implemented in September of 2019. Given several posts have been deleted and some staff have left, contingency plans have been put in place to manage the throughput of work and to maintain service delivery at an operational level. An anticipated impact on staff morale as a result of the movement of some posts is something that the management team have prepared themselves for as an eventuality. Moving forward, the service plans to recruit new staff who provide a robust foundation for delivering the key aims of the service within the community. That said, it cannot be denied that in the short term there remains a risk relating to reduced service capacity, given the current vacancies and potential difficulties in recruiting to specialist roles like the Educational Psychologist.

Historically, we have seen year on year reductions in the number of children becoming a First Time Entrant and fewer children than ever entering the secure estate.  As a result of these successes in the community we work with a complex and challenging cohort of children who have multi-faceted needs and often present a risk of harm to the public or who are themselves highly vulnerable.  These factors together have created pressure in relation to service capacity, our ability to deliver a wider prevention offer and on the re-offending performance within St Helens.  However, it is anticipated that the development of a reducing reoffending action plan in conjunction with analysis of the cohort via the YJSB toolkit, will contribute to improved overall outturn performance in 2019/20. The end of year analysis completed for the last Board in May 2019 has identified patterns in relation to the demographic of our FTE population in relation to their having higher proportions of SEN and often being Looked After. Violent offending is also significantly higher amongst this cohort and that of CR's, which suggests that further work is needed by the service to better understand why this is and target resources more appropriately, thereby making savings for the public purse. 

Moreover, there were 17 young people in total who received a substantive outcome in Q4 and of these 17, 3 (18%) were LAC of St Helens. This brings the total for the year to 16 LAC out of 65 St Helens young people who received a substantive outcome in 2018-19 (25%).  This compares to 18 out of 75 (24%) in the previous year. Proportionally this is indicative of little change over the last 2 years and suggests that Looked After Children continue to be over-represented within our caseload. As a result of this, the Head of YJS has requested a breakdown analysis of the demographic of this population so that we could map patterns of behaviour, identify trigger points and therefore better target prevention for LAC and the resources/ interventions that are needed to address their offending and encourage desistance. Thus far, in terms of offending patterns we have ascertained that that most of our LAC offending occurs in the community overall. However, there is nonetheless a worrying increase in relation to those cases originating from a care & foster placement and this reiterates the need for continued intervention with our local care homes and commissioning to ensure proper adherence to the 10 point plan and RJ as a means of managing poor behaviour within a care setting. 

Sadly, there continues to be a lack of understanding and buy-in from some areas within the partnership regarding understanding the unique needs of LAC and the need to follow the guidelines set out in the revised national protocol to reduce their unnecessary criminalisation. Indeed, Looked After Children continue to be disproportionately represented within the YJ caseload in St Helens YJ - comprising almost a quarter of all of our cases. The LAC Champion role and the Victim Liaison and RJ Coordinator roles were created in an effort to address some of the issues underlying their overrepresentation at a local level. Lack of appropriate provision, accommodation and effective transitions for care-leavers also threaten delivery of services against this local KPI. Combined with this, an unstable workforce within social care (including a lack of capacity across some social care teams i.e. CIN) has translated in practice into some areas of communication and inconsistency for our children. This also includes partners lack of understanding around adopting a trauma-informed approach to working with these children.

As outlined in earlier sections of this report, there is an identified risk in terms of an increase in girls entering the system for the first time, particularly in relation to violent related offending. The newly created Interventions Development Officer post will be expected to target this area of work in an effort to improve outcomes for this group of children. 

Reducing Re-offending continues to present the service with its biggest challenge. This year we have identified a clear risk in relation to performance in relation to the number of post-16 children who are NEET within the caseload. (25%). This will be presented to the next Partnership Board for monitoring, along with a plan of actions to address this. We are currently working in partnership with Careers Connect and Talent Match to target these children and provide them with the support they need to access appropriate ETE. The introduction of a Volunteer/Mentor Co-ordinator will be pivotal to this as ensuring these children have access to mentors for support is anticipated to sustain improved outcomes and performance for these children and bolster their desistance to prevent further offending.

A further risk against this indicator and indeed to all outcome measures is the current local challenge we face in relation to providing a physical health offer to our children. This has become a challenge over the last year due to the physical health offer from our provider being inconsistent. As a result, not all children involved with the YJS are getting a comprehensive health assessment. Again, this is being presented to the Board for challenge in August, as local efforts to resolve this have thus far proven unsuccessful. 

The Centralisation of the Merseyside area Courts which began in January 2018 presents a further risk to the service inasmuch as standardising practice and consistency of delivery is key to ensuring that the children we supervise in St Helens receive the same service as other children appearing before the Courts. In terms of outcome measures, the impact on First Time Entrants, reducing the use of Custody and LAC could be stark. Ensuring that Court staff are all advocating and making good use of the 10 point plan with magistrates to divert those children who slip through the net and may end up in Court inappropriately, will be integral to keeping these numbers down. This is therefore currently a risk for delivery locally in terms of this outcome measure given we have not yet fully achieved this as a group of YOTS on Merseyside. This year, St Helens YJ has taken a lead on the Court Merger and significant progress has nevertheless been made in terms of better integrative collaboration between YJS services across Merseyside, particularly in terms of the creation of a joint SLA, regular court user groups being reintroduced and a more streamlined frontline service that has saved the service £6k in terms of financing. There still remains challenges however, but there is a robust plan in place  approved by HoS to manage these going forward and to improve the services we provide to children in Court across Merseyside. 






9. Conclusion
Despite a challenging year involving substantial change and periods of uncertainty, the YJS service in St Helens has managed to sustain delivery and develop services in relation to all the performance indicators and the commitment of staff and managers to the youth crime agenda is evident in our successes. However, it is recognised that there remains room for continuous improvement in terms of inspection readiness and the significant challenges ahead, particularly in relation to the current embedding of the new whole service restructure planned to start in September 2019. The period of the Summer of 2019 is anticipated to be a challenge for the service in terms of maintaining service delivery and for managers in supporting the current staff to deliver services with potentially less resources whilst some posts remain vacant during the recruitment process. Moreover, the ongoing challenge of reducing the reoffending rates of children within the borough and reducing the over-representation of Looked After Children within the service will require the service to continue to develop its collaborative impetus with the partnership and the local community in order to continue to improve outcomes in this area.

Within the YJSS there is a strong commitment towards promoting public and partner agency confidence through effective practice and performance.  This is recognised as fundamental to ensuring that positive outcomes for the children, parents/carers and victims are achieved.  The planned improvements that are already underway within the service are anticipated to develop and support the enabling of a more dynamic and collaborative YJS in St Helens, in which children are supported to develop and sustain desistance and lead crime-free, productive lives on transition to adulthood.

* Work in SEN schools - the YJS are working on a preventative basis with staff and children in Penkford School - work in Nugent House School is planned to re-commence later in 2019. 
* NPS/CRC Transitions - an Operational Manger in the YJS is involved in the development of a Merseyside Transition Protocol to assist in the management of effective transitions when children reach 18 and require supervision from NPS or CRC.
* Introduction of Learning Circles - in agreement with the LCSB, an Operational Manager at the YJS is piloting the facilitation of a Learning Circle following 2 safeguarding incidents involving a child under YJS supervision looked after by another borough (Learning Circles have not previously been used in St Helens).
* Roll out of National Training on behalf of the YJB - Between Feb - June 19, 2 YJS Managers delivered National training (to all 151 YOTS across 7 regions) on using a 'Less is More' Approach to AssetPlus assessments (National assessment framework for youth justice services).
* Attendance at Strategy/CE2 meetings - the YJS attends strategy meetings for children involved with YJS and other children that are not open to the YJS where appropriate to provide information and consultation.  The YJS also attend all CE2 meetings wherever possible.
* YJS Information Sessions/Presentations - the YJS have a monthly information session aimed at new employees working with children from across the partnership, informing them all about the YJS. In addition, YJS Managers have provided one-off presentations to a number of services across the partnership including Virtual School, Permanence Team, Front Door etc.
* Team around the School - the YJS Victim Worker participates in the Team Around the School meeting at Penkford and the YJS are part of a new pilot to develop this approach across all schools in St Helens using the Signs of Safety Model.
* Multi-Agency Risk Management Meetings (MARMMS) - the YJS hold MARMMS for children when concerns around their safety & wellbeing are high. The meeting format has been adapted to use the Signs of Safety model and in addition, children and their parents/carers are now invited to ensure their voice is central to risk/safety managements plans.
* YJS Partnership Board Induction - this took place in October 2018 for all partnership board members which was successful. Feedback was positive but there still is work to be completed in strengthening the work with some partners.
* RJ Now Training/Pilot - the Victim Worker at the YJS has been receiving support and consultation from Janine Carroll at RJ Now.   In June 19 Janine delivered a 1-day RJ workshop for the YJS to support and develop improvements in relation to our RJ approach. Via this support, the YJS are also piloting using the 'RJ Inquiry' for all new cases of Theft/APV with a view to holding more RJ Conferences.

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
* New structure - a new structure has recently been agreed which will better align the YJS to the current YJ landscape.  As part of the re-structure, there have been 4 new posts created, one of which is an Educational Psychologist.  It is hoped that the introduction of this new post this will improve children's access to the most appropriate provision and ensure that their education support needs are met.  
* Trauma Informed Practice/Approach - all YJS staff are trained in trauma informed practice - this training will be on-going to ensure that YJS staff both understand the needs of children who have experienced Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and how to adapt practice to meet their needs. St Helen's practice is also underpinned by desistance theory, the Good Lives Model and works in line with St Helens Whole Family Approach.
* YJS Away Day - in November 18, the YJS had a full team away day which was successful in re-focusing the service and developing a new strap line - there is a another one planned towards the end of 2019.
* Specialist Supervision - through the Merseyside YOTs Consortium Training Group, a social worker specialist has been commissioned to deliver 4 supervision sessions over a 12-month period to support staff and managers in their work with children displaying HSB, serious violence and children who have suffered childhood trauma .
* YJS Handbook - the YJS have devised a Handbook that can be accessed by all new and existing staff. This provides up to date information and links to Council and YJS guidance and procedures (see attached in supporting evidence).
* Use of check-in/check-out - to improve restorative practice, the YJS have introduced a check-in/check-out at the beginning and end of the staff team meetings
* Agile Working/new IT - all YJS now have a surface-pro which equips them more effectively for agile working.  In addition, all practitioners have been issued with a SMART phone and there are 2 new tablets available to use with children to aid the delivery of interventions 

SERVICE DEVELOPMENT/IMPROVEMENT
* CELLS Project - YJS have collaborated with the CELLS Project - working with children on the periphery of offending or involved in offending, delivering specific sessions focusing on the impact of offending, including life in a custodial establishment - this is a tailored 6-week programme. 
* Prevention Programme - the YJS have increased the prevention offer significantly by promoting the work with partners. 
* Resettlement Guidance/Panel - the YJS has its own resettlement guidance and convene a multi-agency panel to ensure that the child's resettlement back into the community is robust and co-ordinated amongst agencies involved (see attached in supporting evidence).
* Addendum to CE Protocol - an Operational Manager at the YJS is facilitating the creation of an addendum to the Merseyside CE Protocol, focusing on agencies' roles and responsibilities when children have been arrested and the offence/s appear linked to their exploitation.
* Inspection Readiness - In preparation for a forthcoming HMIP Inspection, the YJS have created an improvement plan to assist in being inspection ready (see attached in latter section).
* Mentoring Service - the YJS benefits from an 'in house' mentoring service and the aim is for all children involved with the YJS to have access to a mentor. This can be during their time with the YJS and as a 'step-down/exit strategy'.  The YJS are currently in process of recruiting a new Volunteer Co-ordinator who will oversee the Mentoring Service.
* Barnardos Therapists - in 2018 the YJS secured funding from NHS England for the provision of tier 2 mental health provision and have 1 Barnardos Therapist who works 3 days, based in the YJS office. 
* Review of Management of Out of Court Disposals - the YJS have improved the management of children being assessed for an out of court disposal.  There is a community volunteer on the panel and a programme of intervention is bespoke to the child's needs and can last up to 3 months - learning from recent HMIP Inspections have informed the review and changes implemented.
* New Community Venue for Referral Order Panels - the YJS have been seeking a new community venue for RO Panels - it is hoped that a new venue will be in place by end of September 19.
* Risk Briefing - The YJS have a bi-weekly risk briefing to enable the efficient, swift and reliable sharing of information and intelligence between St Helens YJS, Police and partners.
* Child of Concern List (COCL) - the YJS have introduced a COCL which enables us to keep a track of, monitor and support children effectively. This is a dynamic list that is updated accordingly and the COCL is discussed via the bi-weekly risk briefing.
* Knife Crime Initiatives - The YJS are involved in the Knife Crime Outcome Framework Strategic Group and the YJS have introduced the following initiatives in relation to knife crime:  delivery of at least one session on knife crime to all children involved with the YJS regardless of offence committed (voluntary if not linked to their offence/s); and commission of Street Doctors and data collection to inform the partnership about why children say they have committed knife crime.
* SCLND Screening -  the YJS have recently set up a weekly clinic to undertake screening for children where there are SCLND concerns noted, using 'Do-it Profiler' - the screening will indicate further assessments required;  give hints and tips to improve the child's learning ability and assist them in engagement with future ETE. The screening will be shared with child/carer and with education partners.
* Work with Children Looked After - At present approximately a third of children involved with the YJS are children who are looked after demonstrating a significant over-representation of CLA in the youth justice system - the YJS work hard to try and ensure that all children are not criminalised and have intervened on numerous occasions to divert children from having any criminal disposal - this has been particular prevalent for children who are looked after who have had police input for behaviour in the care home - the YJS have worked hard to ensure such children are dealt with at the lowest appropriate level and provide input via a prevention programme where appropriate - in addition the YJS are committed to raising understanding with care providers and the police about the importance of following the Merseyside Protocol 'Preventing the Unnecessary Criminalisation of Looked After Children'.  Recently under the new re-structure a new LAC Champion has been established, this is a current case manager in the service.
* Number of children in custody - St Helens have had a consistency low custody rate for a number of years and staff work hard to present and deliver robust sentencing packages which provide confidence to the court - at time of writing there are no St Helens children currently in custody.   
* Adherence to GDPR  - to ensure the service is meeting the GDPR requirements, the YJS have achieved a paperless working environment in a short space of time and the YJS HoS has worked hard to ensure that all staff have appropriate IT to enable agile working.What are we worried about?
VOICE OF THE CHILD AND OTHER SERVICE USERS
* Low uptake from children in attending young person's Forum

WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
* Managing change - there have been a lot of changes in a relatively short timeframe at the YJS in an effort to ensure the service is ready for inspection and the positive feedback given at the last Short Quality Screening Inspection in 2015 is maintained - some staff have found this challenging for various reasons. 
* Consistency of performance - there is some inconsistency in performance across the service
* Current gaps in workforce due to re-structure - as part of the re-structure 5 posts have been made redundant and 4 new posts created - Interventions Development Officer, Reparation and Unpaid Worker Coordinator, Educational Psychologist and permanent Volunteer Coordinator (this was a previous fixed term contract post).  This has meant some gaps in service delivery in the short-term, but there is a contingency plan in place including use of YJS Sessional Worker to provide some cover. 
 
PARTNERSHIP WORKING/CONTRIBUTION
The last inspection (SQS) in 2015 found a lack of support from partner agencies "Children and young people in the YOS needed further support from a range of partner agencies, to enable YOS staff to focus on specific direct offending behaviour work" 4 years on and concerns remain about some partners' engagement, contribution and shared understanding in respect of the required input for children involved with the YJS children.   These concerns include:

* Physical Health Needs of YJS Children - the current input from North West Boroughs Health in assessing the health needs and support for all children involved in the YJS is not satisfactory - the YJS have lost the provision of a dedicated YJS nurse and the service is currently being provided by a number of different nurses most without experience of the YJS cohort - the provision is inconsistent, inflexible, resulting in some children not having a health assessment and ultimately concerns that the health needs of these children are not being met. 
* Criminal Justice and Liaison Service - there is no formal ISA across all CJL services provided to the children in St Helens, which enables concerns when children are in police custody or appearing in court to be shared with the YJS   
* Police/care provider response to offending by Looked After Children - although the YJS work hard to ensure that looked after children are not unnecessarily criminalised, there have be a recent increase in inappropriate referrals by the police to the YJS out of court panel.  These have included offences committed by looked after children in care homes  
* Service to care leavers - there have been a number of concerns about the quality of the service for care leavers involved with the YJS  - this has included a lack of a PA which has led to a lack of adequate support to secure move-on accommodation and complete necessary transition work; lack of important documents/accounts (eg passport, bank account, driving licence)  
* Partners' lack of training and awareness of trauma informed practice and HSB  - the YJS have encountered difficulties in agreeing thresholds with social care including differing assessments on an adolescent's vulnerability and the impact of ACEs - although YJS staff are trained in TIP and HSB, this is not the case for a lot of partners in particular social care and schools - although some training is now beginning to take place,  social care staff are not trained in AIM2 and so YJS co-working on HSB cases rarely takes place

SERVICE DELIVERY 
* Quality and standardisation of YJS Court work in Merseyside - there are inconsistencies across the 5 boroughs in Merseyside in relation to YJS court practice and access to each LA's IT systems
* Re-offending performance - our performance for this KPI continues to be a challenge - see the attached performance report  
* Offending and re-offending of Looked after Children - there is a high percentage of St Helens looked after children entering the CJS and this continues to be an on-going challenge - see the attached performance report 
VOICE OF THE CHILD/OTHER SERVICE USERS
* Trauma Informed Environment - the YJS are in the process of trying to improve the facilities for service users and staff at the operational premises - aiming for the physical environment to be in line with the principals of trauma to reduce stress and actively to increase feelings of safety, calm and being welcomed and valued.  (see attachment on the final page)
.
WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
* Consistency of performance -  managers are working hard to support staff to improve their performance - a new impetus for effective Performance Management has been introduced by the HoS -  this has challenged the culture within the service, rendering staff be made accountable for their work and performance - this is a wholly new experience for some of the staff here and managers are working hard to ensure that staff performance is to a consistently high level  
* Trauma Informed Environment - as above
* Recruitment - YJS Operational Managers are in the process of recruiting to the new posts, ensuing this is done in timely manner and a robust selection process take place 

PARTNERSHIP WORKING/CONTRIBUTION
* Physical Health Needs of YJS Children - concerns about the quality of the service provided by NWBH have been raised with the commissioner and a meeting is pending to address these concerns
* Criminal Justice and Liaison Service a YJS Operational Manager is liaising with relevant managers from NWBH and Merseycare to draw up a formal ISA.  However due to the complexities of the arrangements which involves 2 agencies delivering the service and the fact that the service St Helens is requesting an arrangement not in place in other areas in, the creation of a ISA which covers all children not just those involved with the YJS, is taking longer than expected.
* Police/care provider response to offending by Looked After Children - see response below under Service Development
* Service to care leavers - the YJS escalate concerns and where possible provide the support usually undertaken by the PA.   A YJS/CSC Manager meeting is currently being established to address concerns.
* Partners' lack of training and awareness of trauma informed practice and HSB - for a number of yeas the YJS have promoted TIP to partners and managers have sent information to ADs in the council on relevant training.  The lack of appropriate training on TIP and HSB continues to be raised by YJS staff and an YJS Operational Manager sat on a HSB Protocol Implementation Group.  An YJS Senior Practitioner has contributed to a recent partnership event on TIP.
 
SERVICE DEVELOPMENT/IMPROVEMENT
* Quality and standardisation of YJS Court work in Merseyside - St Helens Ops Manager is the manager lead for YJS Merseyside Court Team and is currently working towards completing a SLA and progressing the issues with performance and IT
* Re-offending performance - a reducing Re-offending Action Plan has been in place for the past 12 months and is due to be reviewed in July 2019
* Offending and re-offending of Looked after Children - the YJS continue to:

*challenge inappropriate referrals from the police to the YJS out of court disposal panel
*escalate issues/concerns to relevant police personnel where appropriate
*discuss concerns with care home managers and commissioners and attend the Care Providers   Forum
*analyse performance data to inform the delivery of training to schools and care homes 
*deliver targeted workshops to an identified cohort of children in schools  What needs to happen to achieve positive outcomes for children and their families, by whom by when?Actions required to improve outcomes for the children and families of St Helens can be found attachments below.  The YJS Management Team meet in the following forums.

* Inspection Readiness Meeting: A bi-monthly meeting to review and update the Improvement Plan and oversee the review policy, procedure and guidance documents.

* Management Team Meeting: To discuss service issues; share relevant info; ratify new/amended policies and procedures; monitor key areas of performance to address areas of underperformance, implement any necessary changes in practice.

The YJS also have a Team Meeting for all staff which is chaired and facilitated by staff themselves on a rota basis.  Included in this meeting are standard agenda items - see attached

Appendix 5 End of year performance report

St Helens Youth Justice Service Partnership Board
Annual Performance Report 2018-19
16th May 2018
Introduction
This performance report covers the period 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2019 and focuses on the three National Indicators along with an extra analysis of the LAC population. This is because the number of children who are Looked After as a proportion of the caseload has been identified by the Head of Service as a critical local feature to be improved in St Helens Youth Justice. This report also includes a snapshot analysis of where the service is at in terms of the new National Standards which were introduced this year by the YJB. Going forward, one of these will be looked at in greater detail by the Head of Service in conjunction with the designated Board champions and link Operational Manager on a quarterly basis and an updated included in every report. 

1. Reducing First Time Entrants (FTE)
2. Reducing the use of Custody
3. Reducing Re-offending
4. LAC population
5. New NS snapshot - Standard 1: OOCD
6. Conclusions and Recommendations

1. National Indicator: First Time Entrants (FTEs) to the Youth Justice System
1.1 Out of Court Disposals
There have been 50 children referred to the YJS for Out of Court Disposals in Q4 for 52 occurrences.  This is an increase on the last quarter of 66% and indicates the strong change in direction of travel in Youth Justice, both locally and at a national level, with more children being diverted away from the formal criminal justice path into diversionary intervention. 13 of these interventions were completed successfully, 29 are ongoing and 10 were not completed. Of these, 2 were returned to their home YOT, 2 failed to engage and 6 had their complaints withdrawn (5 by care homes and one by the witness/victim).   13 of these were female (26%).  14(24%) were LAC 4 from St Helens and 8 from other areas. 16 (32%) of these had recorded SEN or ECHP 4 of these had ADHD and 2 had ASD recorded.  A further 4 children (without SEN or ECHP noted) had recorded ASD and 2 had ADHD diagnosis.   Two of these disposals resulted in Youth Cautions and one Youth Conditional Caution was issued. The offences leading to these referrals are shown in the table below.


Of the 22 Drugs offences in Q4, only one was not Possession of Cannabis (possession of Ketamine) which is indicative of the level of seriousness of this type of offending overall. Moreover, in relation to the violent offending, the greatest proportion of these were for the lowest criminal sanction available in this category - section 39 assault (53%). It is pertinent to note that there is a clear pattern over the year in terms of those offences which are being diverted within St Helens and offences of low-level violence features as the most consistently referred case by Police & the Courts to YJ for assessment, with criminal damage, drugs and Public Order following close behind. 

The 17 Violent offences are broken down in the chart below. Notably, almost half of these young people referred for violence were females (8 girls - 47%).  Six of these incidents involved 5 Looked After Children two from St Helens and three from other areas. What is more, almost 60% of these took place in either a care setting or education placement.  Moreover, analysis of the CPS in relation to these cases reveals that all these offences were characterised by acts of impulsivity and no pre-planning. Moreover, 84% of these took place with peers. These two factors at a local level are significant in as much as the children here in St Helens are committing offences characterised by developmental factors influencing children of their age group, namely impulsivity and peer influence. Indeed, research tells us that the pre-frontal cortex, which is particularly important for decision-making and impulse control, is one of the slowest parts of the brain to mature. There is accordingly an imbalance between the onset of heightened emotional stimulus during early adolescence and the later development of a capacity to control impulsiveness. This would appear to play a role in explaining the propensity of teenagers to engage in various forms of risk- taking and explains their parts in offences like these. Moreover, the reduced ability for engaging in skilled social interaction may also, explain, in part, why much adolescent antisocial activity occurs in group settings and why children's decision-making is strongly influenced by how it plays out with the peer-group, rather than by other cost-benefit considerations.  It has also been suggested that an increased focus on contemporaries outside of the family circle represents a natural process of attenuating childhood ties. This susceptibility to peer influence is not dispensed until late teens - or in some cases, even later. Unsurprisingly, research continues to confirm that peer pressure is a significant factor in youth, but not adult, offending. (Kazdin, 2000). 




Ages of children referred for OOCD this year.


The graphs above show that it is predominantly older children, aged 15 and above who are being diverted from Court, with the biggest increase this quarter in relation to 17 year olds. This is encouraging inasmuch as those children about to transition into the adult world have been afforded the best opportunity to desist from further offending and be prevented from starting a lfe trajectory in the adult system where we know research tells us that outcomes for those entering at such a late stage are particularly damaging. (Coleman, 2011 & Bateman, 2012)

Notably, two of the above violent complaints that occurred within the Care Home were subsequently withdrawn by the care staff on the basis that they confirmed with Police that they did not wish these children to be criminalised for their behaviour, particularly given their SEN status. St Helens YJ have been doing much work of late with local care home providers, commissioning and Police partners in order to promote the principles and good practice outlined in the new National Protocol on reducing the unnecessary criminalisation of LAC and examples like these are testament to the fact that this message is starting to be heard.

Yearly summary - OOCD
There has been a total of 158 referrals for the year 2018-19 to the Out of Court Disposal Panel. As outlined in the introduction to this section, this reflects the national picture wherein increasing numbers of children coming into the YJ system are doing so via the OOC route. This is encouraging for all those in YJ and places an important precedent in terms of where YJ professionals' efforts should be focussed if we are to improve outcomes for children, locally. Consequently, St Helens YJ service have developed a robust prevention programme which currently is at capacity in terms of referrals. Again, we are keen to prevent the most vulnerable children entering the CJ system and we see our engagement with the local community, schools and care homes as pivotal to this being successful.




 Below shows a breakdown of the type of incidents that prompted the referral.

Below shows a year on year comparison in referrals to the Out of Court Disposal Panel broken down by incident type.


The graph above clearly shows that we have seen almost a doubling of violent offending by the children in St Helens. However, the in depth analysis of this group provided above shows that this is characterised by the environmental setting; often taking place in a Care Home, home environment or educational placement and by children Looked After - particularly out of area Looked After children whom by their very location, could be expected to be more vulnerable, more distressed and therefore more prone to 'acting out' their emotions and coming to the attention of authority for seemingly anti-social behaviour. Indeed, an analysis of all the incoming data over the last year confirms this to be the case:

There was a total of 95 incidents that were committed by 38 children in either their placement, own home or school in this years' analysis. Of these 38 children, 14 were St Helens children of which 9 were LAC and 24 were LAC from other areas. 

Locations of Incidents:







Outcomes for these Incidents:



It is encouraging to see that a large proportion of these incidents culminated in no further action being taken. Investigation into these suggests that much of this is down to Managers in the service and the seconded Police Officer's joint efforts to liaise with care homes/ schools in relation to the good practice outlined in the protocol for reducing the unnecessary criminalisation of LAC. 

The evidence is that both care homes, placements and educational settings continue to present the most critical local challenges for us in the partnership and the work with care homes and education continues to be a key focus for St Helens YJ Service. We are consistent in the delivery of RJ approaches to managing these children within local area care homes and specialist education providers. Moreover, the whole service restructure which is currently underway has created new YJ Officer post - designated specifically to focus on developing work across the partnership for children who are Looked After. The post will be titled, 'LAC Champion'. They will be expected to play a lead role in the training and educating of care home providers, schools and commissioning in managing the behaviour of these children with the overall aim of attenuating their appearance in the criminal justice system.

1.2	Number of FTEs - April to March (Q1 - Q4)
9 children in St Helen's became a FTE to the youth justice system in Q4, bringing the total to 38 for the year 2018-19. This compares to 39 children in the previous year. Only one of these nine children is a female and one is a LAC of St Helens. Five of these young people had SEN, two have a diagnosis of ADHD.

These nine young people received the following outcomes.


These outcomes were received for the following offences:


Analysis of these nine children by the Head of Service reveals that they were all appropriately dealt with at Court and could not be diverted.  Four of these children had already received a previous Community Resolution for other offences.  Two could not be diverted due to the offences being motoring related, three due to their age and having possession of a knife. One had a significant amount of Cannabis on his person- too much to warrant a POCD, one had a late guilty plea at court and two children acted with high levels of violence and have been subsequently assessed as High Risk of Harm. 

The year on year comparisons for FTE are as follows:



In line with the national picture, we are performing similarly at a local level here in St Helens. The Board will note that this years perfomance is not too dissimilar to last years, with a difference of only one between the 2 years in terms of numbers. Proportionally, it is evident that year on year the numbers are reducing overall and this is good. The graph below shows outcomes for this group of FTE year on year. Notably, there has been a significant rise in the number of children receiving a YCC - an increase of 9 on last years' figures. Conversely, as would be expected there has therefore been a reduction in the number of Referral Orders being given at Court, a reduction of 10 on last years figures overall. Analysis of these 9 YCC's by the Head of Service indicates that all were given appropriately in relation to the level of seriousness of the offending and in relation to the childs' antecedents. It was clear in all cases that these children had been assessed using a trauma informed approach which considered the impact of their own experiences on their behaviour in relation to each incident. 




Type of offences committed -  year on year comparison.


Similarly to what was found in relation to the nature of offending in the OOCD cohort, the numbers of children this year becoming FTE for offences of violence  has also increased - with 4 more children this year in comparison to last year. Encouragingly, since 2016/17, there have been no children coming into the CJS for more serious offences like Arson & Burglary which is highly encouraging and perhaps indivative of the efforts by the partnership to prevent children becoming embroiled in more serious offending or/ and by diverting them along either  a preventative route or OOCD for offences of this nature.
Moreover, this is reiterated by the headline data outlined in the table below. St Helens is performing very well against our family YOT comparator  in the North East, Stockton-on-Tees and the Merseyside, North West and national figures.


Comparison Data Taken from Latest YJB Data Summary St HelensStockton on Tees (family YOT)North WestMerseysideEnglandFTE PNC rate per 100,000 of 10-17 population174222250267250

2.   	National Indicator: Reducing the use of Custody

2.1	Remands to Custody and Associated Costs
There were no St Helens children remanded into custody in 2018-19 which is excellent. 

2.2	Custodial Sentences
 Again, there were no custodial sentences in Q4 out of a possible 18 sentences. This brings the total for the year to 1 out of a possible 66 sentences (1.52%)
Below is the year on year data on custodial sentences which reflects the national picture of a significantly reduced imprisoned child population:


Again, as evidenced by the snapshot below, St Helens continues to perform very well in this area in relation to our local and national comparators. We continue to maintain links within the custodial establishments and we continue to hold resettlement panels for any children who do go to custody in order to ensure their seamless transition to the community and to support them to not re-offend.

3.  	National Indicator:  Reducing Reoffending
Reoffending continues to be the KPI which presents St Helens YJ with its biggest challenge. The Board should be aware that the published data below is not reflective of the current picture locally, as this is 2 years old. We continue to perform less well in relation to our family YOT comparator and against Merseyside, the NW and nationally. 

3.1	Latest Published Reoffending Data
Comparison Data Taken from Latest YJB Data Summery St HelensStockton on Tees (family YOT)North WestMerseysideEnglandReoffending Rates after 12 months April 16 to March 17 (latest period)50.80%48.80%41.80%46.10%40.60%
The graph below gives a better indication of why this may appear to be the case when considering re-offences in relation to the size of the local area being examined. For example, Manchester has over 700 re-offences in comparison to ourselves (circa 200), however, given the relative sizes of each geographical area, this equates to a 'magnified' reoffending rate relative to ourselves. 



Local Reoffending Tracker
The Board will be aware that the service has been tracking our reoffending data at a local level in the YJB reoffending tracker. The HoS agreed to include a snapshot of this data in this performance report at the last Board in order to give the Board a clearer picture of how things are going currently in terms of the children we are most concerned about in this area.
In the period 1/4/17 to 31/3/18 there were 73 St Helens young people who received a substantive outcome (i.e. Youth Caution and above). After tracking these for 12 months we can report the following.
Number in Cohort: 73
Number who re-offended: 20 (This equates to a local reoffending snapshot rate of 27%)  NB: reoffending was only able to be reported on children under 18 years old. This is very encouraging and reflects the impact of the ongoing work being done by the service within the local community and across the partnership in relation to focussing efforts on those children committing the most re-offences.
In summary, the local data shows that the numbers of children going through the system overall are diminishing, the numbers being arrested are dropping and FTE's are declining. However, OOCD's are increasing. It would therefore be useful to look at the outcomes received for those in the re-offending tracker cohort in the next performance report, should this be able to be extrapolated. Furthermore, the service also plans to replicate this with CR's to track their efficacy over time. 





The graphs above show that currently the re-offending rate is around 27% - which is much more in line with what we would hope to see given the efforts that we are going to as a service to reduce or minimise our re-offending by children. However, it is also apparent that those children who do continue to offend commit the most offences and at an increased rate of seriousness in terms of gravity, within 1 - 3 months of being convicted. This tells us that the period immediately following conviction is when our children are most vulnerable to reoffending and more worryingly, are doing so more seriously. Why this should be the case is open to debate but emphasises the critical nature of YJ getting our assessments post-sentence done in a timely way and more importantly, getting these right so that the correct support measures can be put in place to support desistance and deter further offending. 

Furthermore, it is important to consider the impact of a delay in getting started with interventions on these children. Compared to adults, children have a markedly different perspective on time, in part consequence of the fact that one year in the life of an adolescent inevitably seems much longer to him or her than it does to someone who has lived over a much longer period. This perspective therefore logically prioritises short term outcomes over long term consequences and explains the 'disjoint' many children in the system express at the receipt of a court order, like the Referral Order for example, which takes a number of weeks to put in place due to the processes involved. According to this perception of time, this elongated period wherein no intervention or immediate consequence is felt by the child coming from court on conviction could at least in part, explain why many disengage early on and go on to re-offend. For this reason, staff in St Helens YJ are encouraged to initiate and maintain contact with children outside of the required contact dictated by the Order, in an effort to prevent their disengagement with the service.
The Board will also be aware that we have utilised the services of CELLS in the last quarter in order to support our most vulnerable reoffending children and they are in attendance at this month's meeting to update on the progress made thus far. The report in Appendix 2 of this report supplied by them also suggests that this work has made a positive impact on these children, including the children having no further arrests since completion, one has achieved a place in full time employment and one has started a training placement in construction. The Ops Manager who has led on this piece of work will also present to the Board in this meeting.

4. LAC Offending
There were 17 young people in total who received a substantive outcome in Q4 and of these 17, 3 (18%) were LAC of St Helens. This brings the total for the year to 16 LAC out of 65 St Helens young people who received a substantive outcome in 2018-19 (25%).  This compares to 18 out of 75 (24%) in the previous year. Proportionally this is indicative of little change over the last 2 years and suggests that Looked After Children continue to be over-represented within our caseload.

The detail surrounding the circumstances of the 3 LAC children who offended this quarter are as follows:-
NAMEOffence TypeDate Became CLADate of OffenceCircumstancesDate of ConvictionOutcomeLAC typeLHMotoring13/11/200420/04/2018Apprehended with a stolen motor bike. Initially charged with aggravated taking without consent reduced to Interfere with a Motor Vehicle28/01/2019Conditional Discharge and compensation orderFull Care OrderKSViolence07/11/201813/12/2018 KS and a group of youths were causing ASB inside Marks and Spencer's on Church Street.  PCSO's approached the group and took a pedal cycle from one of them, this made KS angry and he lashed out at a glass display causing a number of items to smash.  KS left the scene and was arrested further down the road, he became aggressive with officers and spat at one of them as they were trying to search him.05/02/2019Youth Conditional CautionFull Care OrderLWCriminal Damage01/05/201510/10/2018After being refused any money for cigarettes he poured the contents of a mop bucket onto the living room carpet, threw a kettle against the wall and took a toaster outside into the rear yard to smash it on the floor. The vacuum cleaner was damaged and the contents of it emptied out onto the stair carpet. All in the Care Home causing £170 worth of damage.07/02/2019YROFull Care Order
Examination of the circumstances surrounding these cases gives some reassurances that the outcomes were appropriate in most cases. However, in the case of LW, this child received a YRO for relatively low-level offending within a local care home. Unfortunately, this case is representative of the judiciaries' reluctance to go 'down the ladder' of sentencing inasmuch as this child had already received a Referral Order and a short YRO for more serious offending. Given the nature of the current offence in relation to the antecedents, it could be duly argued that an OOCD would have been a fair and sufficiently punitive measure to manage the risk he presented in light of the current offending; however, the sentencers opted to replicate an Order he has already been in receipt of. Educating our judiciary on the merits of utilising OOCD's for cases like these will hopefully have a positive impact on the outcomes for Looked After Children in court going forward. This is something that the Court Link Manager in YJ will take forward.

Location of Offending by LAC

Notably, the above graph indicates that most of our LAC offending occurs in the community overall. However, there is nonetheless a worrying increase in relation to those cases originating from a care & foster placement and this reiterates the need for continued intervention with our local care homes and commissioning to ensure proper adherence to the 10 point plan and RJ as a means of managing poor behaviour within a care setting.

LAC Offence Type


Again, given the analysis provided in the earlier sections of this report the above data is somewhat unsurprising. We continue to see growing numbers of LAC entering the system for violent offences and for those wherein criminal damage is a feature. 




Outcomes for LAC

In terms of outcomes, it is good to see that year on year we have seen an overall reduction in statutory court outcomes for our children Looked After. This year the increase in YC's and YCC's is also reassuring inasmuch as this means we are appropriately diverting some of our most vulnerable local children away from the formal court process and thereby giving them better life chances as a result.

New National Standards - Self assessment of the service for OOCD's.
The introduction of the new National Standards has been welcomed by St Helens. The Board now has designated Champions in relation to each of these and the Head of Service will now meet with these individual board members and the link Operational Manager ahead of each performance report in order to 'self-assess' where we are at in terms of one standard per quarter in order to inform the Board of our current performance and ensure that it can monitor our overall management of these at a local level with the aim of improving overall performance and outcomes for children. The first of these we have considered is the standard in relation to OOCD. The standards are set out below and have been RAG rated according to the local evidence we considered together. The Board will be pleased to note that we have assessed ourselves as 'Good' in this area as a service and the evidence is highlighted below:

NS performance snapshot - Out of Court Disposals - Standard One.

Youth Offending Team (YOT) Management Boards have mechanisms in place which provide them with assurance that:1Local strategies and services are in place to ensure positive outcomes for children, including sustainable desistance from crime and to prevent children from becoming involved in crime and/or anti-social behaviour2Point of arrest diversion is evident as a distinct and substantially different response to formal out of court disposals3There is effective multi-agency partnership working arrangements for timely information-sharing, planning, decision making and monitoring with key agencies.  Actions happen within agreed timescales and the help and protection is provided to reduce risk and meet need.4Out of Court disposals are prompt, robust and deliver targeted and tailored interventions for sustainable desistance5All actions should be taken to promote diversion into more suitable child- focused system and the promotion of positive constructive behaviour.6Police services and YOTs have a joint protocol setting out locally agreed practice for out of court disposals and a suitable means of joint decision making.7Quality assurance is evident and all decisions are recorded and reviewed8Analysis and action planning is in place to tackle any disproportionality9Improvement is achieved in the quality of pre-court work10YOTs must undertake a timely and accurate, suitable and sufficient assessment of risk and of need for all children referred to the YOT 11Formulate all intervention plans based on that assessment with a focus on promoting a pro-social identity and aiding desistance from crime.12Involve children and their parents/career in assessment, planning and reviewing of individual programmes13Make sure that they work closely with the police (and the Crown Prosecution Service where relevant) for the out of court disposal system to be effective.14Build supportive relationships and deliver prompt, proportionate, effective interventions.
The evidence for the ratings above was gleaned from assessing where we are at locally in relation to a local service action plan we have already drawn up in response to the publication of HMIP's latest thematic inspection report on OOCD's. The Head of YJ, the Ops Manager with the lead for OOCD's and the OOCD Board Champion, Gary O'Rourke (GMP) went through the above standard and in relation to each, we evidenced the good practice we have locally which supported the rating we gave it.  This is provided in the appendix of this report - Appendix one. In brief, there are a number of identified strengths in St Helens in relation to OOCD's and these include: 
* Diverse OOC panel including a volunteer from local community, YJ Police officer & victim liaison officer as well as input from safer communities officer where required
* strong links with YJ Police Officer and locality policing to inform use of the 10 point plan, 
* strong links with YJ Management and Commissioning/ care homes to inform use of the 10 point plan,
*  individualised robust assessments for CR's which are signed off proportionate to the impact of the offending as determined by panel.
* YJ has a robust prevention offer in St Helens
* Robust internal QA mechanisms for oversight of decisions made
* Strong links between YJ Management, Police and CPS for escalating cases - diverting back where needed
* All interventions completed on average within 3 months as per good practice guidelines for timely and speedy intervention.
In terms of where we need to improve, we felt that the partnership could improve our overall response to managing and responding to disproportionality in the OOCD caseload. We are good when it comes to responding to Looked After children within this cohort; however, we need to get better in responding to other areas of diversity including things like ethnicity, disability etc. 

5. Conclusion and Recommendations
In summary, St Helens Youth Justice is currently performing well in relation to 2 of the 3 KPI's (reducing the use of custody & reducing FTE's). As a service we have worked hard over the last year to respond to the messages inherent in the data analyses we do on an ongoing basis, both to improve the services we deliver for children and more recently; in terms of re-shaping the service itself, in order to better offer a service that responds to these identified needs. We have focussed our efforts collectively on developing work across the partnership which is integrative and which aims to reduce re-offending by our most vulnerable and 'at risk' children - delivering training and support to identified special schools in the locality, to local police decision-makers and increasing our contact with care homes and commissioning in order to ensure that in the case of Looked After Children, the 10 point plan is adhered to in all cases that come to the attention of police and that those cases which are deemed unnecessary criminalisation are returned to Police & the Court for reconsideration. 
The coming year presents the same ongoing challenges in terms of reducing our re-offending rate, but we hope that the Board is encouraged by the evidence gleaned from the local tracker which indicates that the current picture is considerably lower than that of the most recently published PNC data. We have built and forged links with the voluntary sector and have utilised the innovative approach of CELLS in order to build desistance and resilience in the services most vulnerable children and this has yielded some very positive early indicators of success. We hope to continue to offer this on a rolling basis and will keep the Board updated on the outcomes obtained.
