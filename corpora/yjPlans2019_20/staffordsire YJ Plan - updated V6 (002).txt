On behalf of Staffordshire Youth Offending Service (SYOS) Management Board, welcome to the Youth Justice Plan for 2019-2020 which provides an overview of the work of the Youth Offending Service in Staffordshire. It sets out details of performance over the past twelve months and our priorities for the coming year.

Staffordshire Youth Offending Service (SYOS) performs a key role in helping to prevent offending and reoffending, importantly, work to reduce the use of custody coupled with the contribution to multi-agency public protection and safeguarding is in place. By working together with key partners - the police, children's services, health services, probation, community safety and both voluntary and private sector providers - SYOS delivers high quality and effective services to children, their families and the victims of offending.
SYOS performance results in 2018-19 continue to be positive; we do however, acknowledge the challenges raised given the recent increase in the number of first-time entrants across the County. Work is underway to explore the reasons behind the increase which will make recommendations to enable SYOS to address this during 2019-20. On a positive note, the number of custodial sentences has reduced: the implementation of youth custody panels in Staffordshire YOS ensures the correct decisions are being made for our children, importantly, good levels of scrutiny are applied. 

We continue to work on our integrated model to support the needs of our multi-faceted and complex children. Importantly, any deficit in integration across partner agencies that affects the child focused approach to working with children can become an insurmountable challenge. On that basis, the key priorities for 2019-20 include: Embedding the patch-based working approach; working with Police to establish a cross agency strategic forum; a review of the roles of the Police working in the YOS; developing relationships with voluntary and community services and working closely with Health to ensure appropriate pathways are in place across emotional and mental health provision. 

The SYOS Board in 2018-19, has undergone some significant membership changes. As well as agency membership changes, the former Chair, Trish Caldwell, County Commissioner (Staffordshire) has stepped down, I am honoured to have taken over this role from April 2019. I would like to formally thank Trish for her work as Chair and look forward to building on this in the coming year. Board members have committed to developing the levels of maturity required coupled with a greater level of accountability throughout the coming year to ensure SYOS is able to meet the stated objectives included in this annual plan.

Board members are also committed to continuous improvement and have agreed priority leads to take forward recommendations and learning from Youth Offending inspection reports and to take forward the implementation of the new National Standards for Youth Offending Partnerships. 

As always, the Board are grateful for the commitment and hard work of the Managers, employees and volunteers in SYOS, it remains that their dedication will enable us to achieve our aims for this year. On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Youth Justice Plan for 2019-20: Supporting Children and Families to make Positive Changes and Make Safer Communities: Children First

2. Introduction and review of achievements 

2018/19 was a challenging year for SYOS. Previously the national review of the Youth Justice System - The Ministry of Justice, Charlie Taylor Review (2016), reported that the Youth Justice System in England and Wales continued to see significant reductions in children requiring community Youth Offending Services and custodial settings. Indeed, the number of children and young people supervised within the statutory framework, by SYOS, has decreased over the last three years - in line with national trends
   
On that basis, Staffordshire County Council's (SCC) contribution to SYOS was reduced by £300,000 by March 2018 with a further £100,000 cut from funding by March 2019. Such reductions were in addition to £100,000 reduction already made by SCC in 2016/17, totaling a saving of £500,000 for SCC between 2016 and 2019. The reduction was approved as part of the Mid-Term Financial Savings (MTFS) approval process in February 2017. The reduction in contribution would only impact on resources paid for by Staffordshire County Council. 
Given such significant financial reductions in funds, a full review of SYOS was undertaken. Following a period of consultation, the new SYOS structure was presented to SYOS staff in September 2018 and concluded to full implementation on 15 March 2019. The new structure sees SYOS delivering services from two operational "Hubs" in the North and South of the County. 
Over the last year, Staffordshire has continued to develop its practice with regard to the delivery of Out of Court Disposals and prevention activity, such is the fast-growing pace of interventions required for Early Help and intervention to support the prevention of offending in Staffordshire.
Cordis Bright were commissioned by the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner in Staffordshire to undertake a thematic review of Prevention in both Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent. 
The report produced in November 2018 highlighted several strengths in SYOS in the current prevention provision including the co-location of SYOS prevention workers, the specialised prevention staff who had developed good partnership working, supported parenting and family support interventions and supported the development of restorative justice services.  Feedback from children, staff and stakeholders was very positive and the report made the following conclusion:
Staffordshire and Stoke-On-Trent YOS services are each offering a comprehensive range of prevention services. Based on feedback from stakeholders, the overall quality of service provision in each authority appears to be high and is respected widely.
In addition during 2018/19 Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent YOS undertook a comprehensive Review of the Partnerships and Operational functions common to both services; the review was undertaken by the Heads of Service for both YOTs. The findings from this review, extracted from the detailed analysis about the functions of both services was presented to both YOT Management Boards and are being used to inform future operational delivery models within the County and City. The findings have also been used to formulate the service delivery plan for Staffordshire Youth Offending Service 2019/20 and are included within this Youth Justice Plan. 
Between April 2018 and March 2019 the number of young people entering the Youth Justice System for the first time in Staffordshire is increasing and although Staffordshire's rate continues to be lower than National averages it is higher than its family group. 

The total number of First Time Entrants (FTE) this year is higher than last year's outturn but importantly is in line with the 2015/16 and 2016/17 outturns. 


This slight increase in FTE's should be viewed in the context of the work that Staffordshire is undertaking via the "Triage" process to administer Out of Court Disposals (OoCD). This process means that SYOS is now dealing with significantly more children to divert them from statutory services. Between November 2017 and the end of March 2019, 544 young people were assessed through the triage process. Most of these children accepted the triage outcome and agreed to work with the Youth Offending Service on a voluntary basis (only 14 declined).  
Just under one fifth of the children who accepted the triage outcome and worked with SYOS have committed a further offence (100/522) and of those who have committed an offence, 21 young people have committed a further offence.
The Ministry of Justice have made several changes to the Proven Reoffending National Statistics to support the reforms to the management and rehabilitation of offenders in the community across England and Wales. One of these changes is moving from a 12-month cohort to a three-month cohort. Additionally, there has been a change in the data source used to compile statistics for the October to December 2015 further cohorts. Therefore, we should be cautious when comparing the figures for these cohort to earlier cohorts. 
There are 65 young people in the latest cohort (January to March 2017), of whom 28 re-offended (43.1%) who committed 104 re-offences within a 12-month period.  This proportion is above the national (39.9%), and Midlands (36.1%) averages. Staffordshire YOS is aware of the need to reduce this and is using the data contained within a "Live Tracker" tool which will enable the service to target the children who are at most risk of re-offending.
The number of young people entering custody in Staffordshire increased in 2017/18 in comparison to the previous 3 years. Between April 2017 and March 2018 13 young people were sentenced to custody (16 episodes) in Staffordshire.  In 2018/19 11 young people have been sentenced to custody (13 episodes) which demonstrates a reduction. 
SYOS is developing the service as a trauma-informed organisation. Research has provided a rich source and level of understanding about the risks that can impact on a child's development and how they exist at multiple layers. Research also tells us that early targeted intervention is central to prevent problems occurring or tackling them head-on before they escalate.  The research into Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE's) has furthered understanding about the impact multiple risk factors can have on a child's development. Many of the children the YOS works with have experienced one or many traumatic experiences, such as bereavement, witnessing domestic violence, experiencing abuse or neglect. SYOS is committed to enhancing community safety through staff who are trauma informed and can provide a trusting relationship to support the achievement of good outcomes via assessment of need and the delivery of interventions to children and young people. 
Training for all practitioners and managers around trauma informed practice has been delivered and will support the SYOS vision: "Supporting positive changes for Children and Families to achieve safer communities"- Children First.
After 2 years of hard work and development Staffordshire Youth Offending Service has been awarded the Restorative Service Quality Mark (RSQM) by the Restorative Justice Council, in recognition of its high-quality restorative justice interventions with children and victims. 
The RSQM is a badge of quality which guarantees that a service provides safe, high quality restorative practice which meets the six Restorative Service Standards. Staffordshire Youth Offending Service joins other RSQM awardees - in sectors ranging from criminal justice through education to care - delivering high quality restorative processes.

"High quality restorative interventions play a key role in diverting young people away from the criminal justice system. Congratulations to Staffordshire Youth Offending Service on achieving the RSQM which demonstrates its commitment to providing safe and effective restorative practice throughout its service." 

Jim Simon, Chief Executive of the Restorative Justice Council

3. Leadership and Governance
Governance arrangements sits within the Staffordshire multi-agency YOS partnership and has senior officer level representation from statutory agencies and other key partners to inform strategic decision-making and facilitate resource allocation where required. The chair of the YOS Partnership is Jamie Ann Edwards: Head of Staffordshire & Stoke National Probation Service.
SYOS sits within Staffordshire County Council's Families First portfolio, bringing together the delivery of a full range of front-line services to children and their families. Within Families First, SYOS is an integral part of Specialist Safeguarding Services, with the Head of Service for the YOS reporting directly to the Strategic Lead (Specialist Safeguarding) who provides management accountability and oversight. 

The SYOS Management Board meets quarterly with representatives from statutory agencies and other partners in attendance, in line with Youth Justice Board (YJB) guidance. SYOS is also part of the internal governance and performance arrangements operational throughout Families First. Youth Justice Board audits have demonstrated compliance with conditions specific to grants and with timely submission of data and audits.   

Performance reports are prepared for the SYOS Board by the Business Improvement and Development Team (BIDT), which focus on key statutory indicators. The revised SYOS Re-Offending Tracker which looks at real-time data enables a better understanding about the cohort of children who re-offend. 
The SYOS Management Board holds collective responsibility to ensure that multi-agency working is effective and for unblocking any barriers to participation. During 2018-19 the SYOS partnership had full participation from all statutory partners, which supported the delivery of the priority plan. Many of the priorities identified within the SYOS Youth Justice Plan 2019/20 focus on the continued development of partnership working to support co-operation and improve outcomes for children. 

The SYOS management team supports a range of local partnership arrangements, ensuring that the youth justice agenda is effectively represented. This includes membership of the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements Strategic Board; the Building Resilient Families Leadership Group; the Offender Management Development Commissioning Board and the Staffordshire Youth Court Panel Chairs Group.

SYOS is represented at the Stoke on Trent & Staffordshire Safeguarding Children Board by the Head of Service and the Strategic Lead, Specialist Safeguarding. All critical incidents reviewed in SYOS are reported to the Stoke on Trent & Staffordshire Safeguarding Children Board, with a SYOS Management Board member taking responsibility for leading on the review.


4. Resources and Value for Money 

Funding for Staffordshire Youth Offending Service 2019-2020 is made up of contributions from statutory partners, Children's Services; Police; Health; Probation; Youth Justice Board and the Staffordshire Commissioner. SYOS also oversees the local authority budget provided to meet the cost of children remanded to the secure estate. Funding provides cover for statutory interventions to meet National Standards and with general management and administration costs. This Plan outlines the partner contributions to the Youth Offending Partnership Pooled Budget, all of which are utilised in the delivery of youth justice services.

The SYOS Board is presented with a comprehensive financial position at a quarterly Board meeting and the financial position is formally reviewed within this context. The information presented to the SYOS Board informs priority planning and decision-making to address forthcoming challenges.

Audit certification and scrutiny from the SYOS Board confirm the appropriate use of the YJB Grant. In addition, all statutory partners have sustained a level of commitment to SYOS. Health contributions fund the secondments of Child and Mental Health Assessment Services (CAMHs) nurses and general practice nurses and emotional and mental health nurses. 

Partner contributions fund the statutory duties of SYOS including court officers, social workers, YOT officers (including education, training and employment officers) and probation officers who risk assess, write reports and carry out statutory interventions and activity with children. 







5. Partnership Arrangements 

Services are delivered by Staffordshire Youth Offending Service in accordance with the statutory legislation set out in the Crime and Disorder Act (1998), the updates received in the Criminal Justice Act (2003) and the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act (2013).  There are now two core Youth Offending Hubs situated in the North and South of Staffordshire. Youth Justice, Prevention and Early Help Practitioners are integrated into both hubs and within each hub there is a range of seconded staff from partner agencies, i.e. police, probation and health. 

There continues to be excellent collaborative working between Criminal Justice Liaison & Diversion team and YOS Child Assessment Mental Health Service which provides a seamless service for children; this is underpinned by an exceptional mutual respect for each other's assessment, recommendations for health intervention and a genuine willingness to work together in the best interests of the children, parents and carers we support.  The statutory mental health nurses in the North Hub maintain close links with the Mental Health Criminal Justice Team to continue to develop working together to ensure continued effective transitions

The NHS Liaison and Diversion partnership continues to develop: the provision of early health screening for children who receive out of court disposals and is a valued resource. There has however been a deficit in health screening and assessments for children referred into Prevention and Early Help, which has been recognised. However, the partnership is keen to address this deficit and have agreed this as a priority for 2019-20.  

Safeguarding of vulnerable children is a priority for SYOS; our priorities are children who are looked after; those not in education, employment or training (NEET); those who have special educational needs, those at risk of child sexual exploitation (CSE);  those at risk of Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) those with a history of being reported missing and those assessed at being at a high risk of re-offending.  










SYOS are partners attending the current monthly multi-agency CSE panels across the County and are now integrated into the Vulnerable Adolescents Multi Agency Panel (VAMAP) panels. The panels have been developed out of Contextual Safeguarding and is in recognition and response to the increasing awareness regarding the exploitation of children involved in County Lines.  

SYOS is well placed within Families First, the Safer & Stronger Partnership and the Staffordshire Safeguarding Children Board to ensure that wider strategic developments reflect the needs of children who are involved in the Criminal Justice System.
  
Staffordshire County Council is now in Year 6 of its Building Resilient Families and Communities (BRFC) work.  SYOS is committed to the whole family approach and has worked collaboratively with partners to deliver the BRFC agenda in Staffordshire. In 2019 the Youth Justice, Prevention and Early Help Practitioners were aligned to the BRFC agenda with SYOS implementing an agreed process with BRFC partners that all referrals into Youth Justice, Prevention and Early Help will be assessed using the Early Help Assessment "Outcome Star" material. This allows for synergy in assessments for this cohort of children and families and falls in line with the wider partnership workers. 

SYOS has worked closely to maintain our good relationship with adult justice colleagues from National Probation Service (NPS) and the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) around the transition of young people to adult services. 

Partnership work with the local Secure Estate continues to be strong and effective and SYOS works to ensure that the partnership continues to improve resettlement practice. 





The Service has refreshed the education, training and employment approach with work undertaken in collaboration with relevant partners. The Service has also taken part in a 2-year, Achievement for All Department for Education funded project, which is to improve the outcomes for children in the criminal justice system who have special educational needs and disability (SEND). The relationship between SYOS and the wider SEND partnership has improved with the SYOS County Manager now a member of the Strategic SEND Partnership Board.



Retention of volunteers within the YOS continues to be important. SYOS currently has 22 volunteers in the North and South hubs which includes a wide range of people who reflect the diverse population of the County.

 
6. Risks to Future Delivery against Youth Justice Outcome Measures 

The number of children entering the statutory youth justice system has reduced over the last few years which is a positive affirmation for the approach of intervening much earlier through Prevention and Early Help referrals from partner agencies and the Out of Court Disposal system which can have a positive impact on the number of First Time Entrants. 

However, SYOS is increasingly responding to children who have entrenched complex and multi-faceted needs, requiring a holistic approach to intervention to achieve positive outcomes.  A key challenge to the SYOS partnership is the engagement with a cohort of children who are most disaffected and who are more likely to be drawn into the criminal justice system. A significant number of children who are excluded from school often find themselves immersed in the criminal justice system. Interventions with children who are disaffected can require much more creative and potentially expensive resources to try and engage and motivate them to achieve and aim high. SYOS is seeking to innovatively use the strong partnership links across Staffordshire to creatively address these needs. Moreover, in recognition of the reducing number of children entering the criminal justice system coupled with a significant budget reduction, SYOS will need to ensure that there is an effective and appropriately trained workforce to address the complex presentations for those children referred into SYOS. A staff skills audit is currently being completed to understand what the training needs are for the staff in SYOS.

Remand costs remain an area of risk being dependent on several factors mainly outside the service's control including the nature and seriousness of the offences committed where alternatives to custody may not be appropriate. Future costs cannot be reliably forecast.

Capita Youth Justice case management system continues to prove challenging for SYOS.  Although the system is now fully embedded with staff having adapted well to the change and the process of recording work, there are still significant outstanding issues which are in the process of being addressed. They include:

* Not being able to send vital assessment documents direct from the system when a child enters custody
* System upgrades
* Limited reporting function available including restorative justice, health and education, training and employment data

These ongoing matters have been highlighted at the highest possible levels within the LA and with Capita. A Task Group is in place working together to review the current system with the view to consider alternative YOS case management systems. 


First Time Entrants and Re-Offending
SYOS has seen a small increase in its FTE's in 2018/19. The Board has commissioned a piece of work to understand First Time Entrants and Re-offending and has put actions in place to address this area of performance. The implementation of a county-wide scrutiny panel for Out of Court Disposals has been developed to ensure that there is a good level of consistency in the rationale/ decision making with regard to Out of Court disposals. It is hoped that the scrutiny afforded surrounding the decision making will lead to a reduction in children receiving inappropriate statutory outcomes and the potential for a reduction in the First Time Entrants. The Live Tracker tool is also assisting the service to identify children at most risk of re-offending and to implement strategies to reduce the risks. 

Disproportionality
SYOS recognises that children who are known to youth justice who are identified as Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) have diverse needs. The partnership has utilised a disproportionality toolkit to identify areas of development and an audit is underway against the Lammy Review1 to review practice. 
Workforce Management
Staffordshire Youth Offending Service aims to develop and maintain a high-quality workforce and to support professional development and opportunities for staff to meet the needs of a changing children's workforce. 
* Revised service structure now functions as two Hubs operating across the county
* More fluid and agile workforce due to the whole service now having 4G devices
* Team briefings take place weekly to manage competing demands 
* A SYOS manager has completed the Institute of Leadership and Management Programme
* Effective supervision and development of staff in accordance to the Families First Supervision Policy 
* Workforce Development Plan in place
* Restorative Justice Council accredited training is delivered to all staff
* Effective Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Protocol and working arrangements are in place

All members of staff are expected to attend quarterly service development days YOS involving contributions from our own staff and external partners about issues of service-wide significance.
