APPROVAL OF PLAN
Reviewed and approval of the Youth Justice Partnership Plan 01/04/19 - 31/03/22


 



Eifion Price, Chair of North Somerset Youth Offending Service Management Board     







1. Summary

North Somerset Youth Offending and Prevention Service (YOS) is accountable to a multi-agency YOS Management Board, addressing the agendas of public protection - risk of harm to others and preventing of offending, child/family welfare within a safeguarding context, and ensuring Court sentences are served.  The YOS focus is required to deliver against the three-national youth crime and justice outcomes of reducing re-offending, reducing first time offending and reducing use of custody which are measured through the three national indicators:

NI 111		First time entrants in the criminal justice system
NI 19		Reducing re-offending
NI 43		Use of custody

Additionally, the YOS measures: education, training and employment engagement; suitable accommodation; mental health/substance misuse assessment and treatment timelines and outcomes. A Needs Assessment and Treatment Plan for 18/19 - 19/20 in relation to substance misuse has been submitted to Public Health England.

In 18/19 no young people were remanded in custody or required a custodial sentence which is a marked contrast to 14/15 when 15 young people received custodial sentenced and 2 remand episodes. In 18/19 the lowest first-time entrants of 66 (292 in 06/07) into the criminal justice system was recorded evidencing a continuing year on year reduction. At the same time in 18/19 there was the highest number of youth inclusion support programmes delivered i.e. not receiving a criminal justice disposal; and of the 109 programmes completed in that year none of the young people were recorded as having any convictions during the 6 months after programme completion. 

On 11/09/13 the YOS was verified as providing a young people friendly service and meeting the Department of Health 'You're Welcome' quality criteria. The YOS was re-accredited on 21/06/18 for a further three years by Public Health, North Somerset Council. 

The YOS contributes to the strategic and operational plans of the agencies represented on the YOS Management Board. This includes the North Somerset Council Corporate Plan 2015-2019. For example, contributing to the 'Health and Wellbeing' Vision outcome through supporting families to give their children the best start in life.  The Youth Justice Partnership Plan is a constitutional plan of North Somerset Council thus ensuring a high level of visibility, accountability and ownership. This plan is submitted to the Youth Justice Board in accordance with Governmental requirements.


2. Partnership Arrangements

The YOS both strategically and operationally has strong links with a vast array of partners to address risk, and promote protective factors which relate to the three national indicators:  	 

* Clinical Commissioning Group and NSC Public Health: maintenance of mental health and substance misuse interventions e.g. Substance Advice Service; and the YOS Mental Health specialist role, a recently established mental health post in partnership with NHS England and local Clinical Commissioning Groups which provides interventions across Children's Services.
* Police: through early intervention strategies to reduce first time entrants, shared working of the Out of Court Panel, integrated offender management and victim contact work. This includes the significant roles of the two Police secondees to the YOS. 
* National Probation Service (NPS) as statutory partner to YOS, including by way of Probation Officer secondee in case holding and responsibilities in relation to transition through to adult supervision.
* The Community Rehabilitation Company (Contractor: Working Links) offering rehabilitation and monitoring services to allocated cases from NPS.
* Transitioning young people with substance misuse issues to Addaction through shared transitioning meetings with young people. 
* Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner in grant aiding Youth Inclusion Support Project and Substance Misuse Service and shared work on young people's participation, and restorative justice development; and through the commissioning of North Somerset YOS to deliver the Young Victims' Service across Avon and Somerset.
* South West Resettlement Consortium (statutory and independent sector organisations): e.g. as reflected in intensive interventions delivered by Future4Me,1625 Independent People to those being resettled from custody and/or from Local Authority Care.
* NSC People and Communities Directorate Support and Safeguarding section (where the YOS is hosted): shared working e.g. in relation to advancing positive outcomes for Children in Need and Looked after Children, the development of the Troubled Families Agenda in Phase 2, and an integrated approach to assessment and interventions with young people committing harmful sexual behaviour. The Children's and Young People's Support and Safeguarding strategy, January 2017-20 incorporates the YOS contribution as part of an integrated approach. 
* Participation in the Local Safeguarding Board, and in Avon and Somerset wide MAPPA arrangements.
* YOS facilitated multi-agency Panel - assessing interventions in relation to young people sentenced to custody - reporting into the YOS Management Board.
* A lead strategic and operational role in the delivery of the 'Troubled Families' High Impact Families Programme across North Somerset.

3. High Impact Families (Troubled Families) Programme

In June 2013 North Somerset YOS and Community Safety Drug Action Team undertook the strategic lead and operational development of the High Impact Families Programme (HIFP) on behalf of the HIFP Board. This has involved significant YOS involvement in the development of a whole family approach across partner agencies, and in the delivery of engagement with families and Payment by Results targets set by the Department of Communities and Local Government. 

The national targets e.g. in relation to education, training and employment, anti-social behaviour, and youth crime are pertinent to the YOS agenda of working with young people within a family context.

YOS Practitioners are significantly involved in delivering interventions and/or case holding cases which meet the HIFP criteria. 

4. Development of Effective ('Good') Practice

The YOS is committed to continuous professional development - staff and volunteers, and in partnership the practice of related agencies / departments in achieving business objectives.

The Forward Plan details area of effective practice development. Current themes to highlight:
* Development of YOS case practice in Troubled Families (High Impact Families Programme) case holding and contribution to those cases held by others. 
* Focus on ensuring plans and delivery thereof maximises the potential to reduce re-offending.
* Promotion of partner agency shared working to reduce use of custody as appropriate.
* Provision of assessment and interventions with young people exhibiting harmful social behaviour. 
* Engagement in Youth Justice Board Effective Practice Days e.g. concerning the ongoing focus on ensuring the effective use of Asset Plus. 
* Development of enhanced case management with a trauma informed approached.

5. Short Quality Screening Inspection

The HMI Probation Inspectorate Short Quality Screening Inspection across England and Wales was completed at the end of 2016. North Somerset was inspected at the beginning, in November 2012. The Inspection which was conducted across four themes of reducing the risk of reoffending; protecting the public; safeguarding young people; and ensuring that Court sentences are served. The overall report was positive with 80% achieved against the scoring matrix and with outstanding strengths in:

* Services provided to Courts, particularly pre-sentence reports being of very high standard;
* assessment of diversity factors and barriers to engagement with enhancements to practice through learning style questionnaires and communication skills screening tools;
* good levels of compliance and effective enforcement of court orders;
* engagement of young people and parents / carers in initial assessment and planning; and
* positive outcomes for young people as the remit of multi-agency working

Additionally, victim contact was positively commented upon.
Areas requiring improvement were highlighted as:
* assessment of the likelihood of re-offending and risk of harm to others
* effectiveness of middle management oversight.

In the next round of inspection commencing in 2018 the HMI Probation Inspectorate plans to inspect organisational delivery including governance and partnership arrangements; Court and Out of Court disposals.


6. Profile of Youth Offending

60% of North Somerset is considered rural, 40% of the total population lives in Weston-super-Mare and 30% in the towns of Clevedon, Nailsea and Portishead. Overall, North Somerset is a prosperous area, scoring above national average on key health, crime, education and employment indicators. However, around 10% of North Somerset's population lives in areas that are amongst the 20% most deprived in England. All of these are in Weston-super-Mare, however, there are also significant pockets of deprivation in the other towns and in some villages. 

* Based on the 2017 population mid-year estimates there were a total of 47,282 children and young people aged 0-19 living in North Somerset, about 22.2% of the total population
* 93.6% of pupils in North Somerset are of white British or other white origin, with 5.8% from a black or minority ethnic background, 0.6% Not obtained (2019 January School Census).
* 68 young people received a substantive outcome in 2017/18 of whom 87.9% are of white British or other white origin, with 2.9% from a black or minority ethnic back ground and 7.4% unknown (2018/19: 94yp, 92.5% White British, 1.1% Black or Minority background & 6.4% unknown).

An individualised approach ensures ethnicity and cultural aspects are recognised and considered in work with young people and families.

For further information in relation to the North Somerset profile refer to The North Somerset Children and Families Partnership Plan for 2016-2019; and the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment.

Criminal justice outcomes in North Somerset for 18/19 shows 96 court and pre-court outcomes, relating to 286 offences, committed by 68 young people resident in North Somerset. This equates to an offending rate of 0.37% a reduction of 0.15% on 2018/19. This figure is 68 young people of the 10-17y population of 18,591. (2017/18; 125 court and pre-court outcomes, 261 offences, 94 young people resident, 0.52% offending rate)

Overall 18/19 shows a 23% reduction in the number of outcomes and an 29% reduction in number of offenders compare to 16/17.

Overall there is a 12.6% reduction in the number of offences on the previous year (17/18). Violent offences remain high and continue to account for over a third (33%) of all offences. A 19% increase in Motoring (12%) and vehicle theft (2%) can be attributed to one prolific young person (21 offences). Other prevalent offences were Theft 14%, Criminal Damage, 10.5%, Drug offences 8.3% 


Most young people offending, 64.7% (44), were resident in Weston East (25.5X%) and Weston South (41.2%) locality areas. (2017/18;69.6% (64): Weston East 42.4%, Weston South 27.2%)



7. Workload 2017-18

During 2018-19 the YOS has delivered on 529 programmes including 6 Advocacy 14 Independent Visiting and 43 Mentoring Programmes. Additionally, 131 AssetPlus assessments, and 181 Youth Inclusion Support Project, 160 Specialist Health, 4 AIM (young people displaying sexually harmful behaviour) assessments and 40 Appropriate Adult interviews, 36 of which were provided by Somerset YOT at the Bridgwater Custody Suite. (2017/18; 548 programmes, 278 criminal justice & youth inclusion support assessments, 140 Health, 3 AIM & 6 Parenting assessments, 34 Appropriate Adult Interviews). The Attendance Centre is detailed below.
There were 13 Pre-Sentence Reports and 11 Breach Reports completed for court. The appropriate use of breach demonstrates robust enforcement in relation to non-compliance occurring.  There were 23 Initial, 40 reviews, 8 Breach and 37 final reports to Youth Offender Panels. There were 23 reports completed for the Out of Court Youth Panel. (2017/18; 13 PSRs, 30 Breach Reports, 6 Parenting Orders. Referral Order Reports: 22 Initial; and 36 Review and 20 Final reports to the Youth Offender Panel).

All programmes have assessment based interventions that are agreed with the young person and parents/carers and are designed to meet individual identified need and address risk of offending, harm and safeguarding issues. Thus, there is an individualised approach, within a family context, which enables recognition of personal identity and any related issues.


8. Junior Attendance Centre

Following upon a successful submission to the Youth Justice Board North Somerset was funded to establish an Attendance Centre. The first session took place on 5 September 2015. The Centre has seen young people attending the YOS programmed provision on Saturdays. This is provided as part of Court Order requirement or supervision plan, an Out of Court Caution, or on a voluntary basis. During 2018-19 18 young people attended completing a total of 85 sessions.

9. Mentoring, Advocacy and Independent Visiting of Children Looked After and Missing Children Interviews for Those who are Children in Care of the Local Authority.

Since the 1st October 2015 the brief of the YOS was extended from working with vulnerable young people who might be at risk of offending to Children Looked After/Care Leavers who may request advocacy, mentoring, or independent visits thus bringing the existing staff skill set to these areas of activity with Children looked After. Children Looked After statistically figure significantly across risk areas e.g. in relation to school attendance/attainment, health outcomes and offending behaviour. This provision has realised significant increase in mentors: currently 34 trained mentors. As well as Children Looked After we have four post 18 years of age Care Leavers matched with mentors. The Mentoring Service is in great demand. Before consideration for mentoring other brief interventions are usually delivered to explore whether this will address needs/risks whilst informing a mentoring match should this still be judged necessary.

On request, where there may be a need for someone independent of the social worker, Junction 21 also provides a return interview for young people who have been missing.


10. Victim Engagement and Restorative Justice

The YOS is committed to the joint agendas of Victim Services and Restorative Justice whereby the interests and needs of victims of youth crime is kept to the fore. The YOS delivers victim contact work in the light of the revised Code of Practice for Victims of Crime (December 2013). All identifiable victims are contacted, where appropriate, and offered the opportunity to have input into what happens in their case. For example, at the Pre-Court stage where decisions are being made as to whether to issue a Youth Caution or a Youth Conditional Caution, or to report for summons, victims' views are sought and actively considered in the decision making. Post-Court victims are offered the opportunity to make a victim statement, receive direct reparation (or select indirect reparation), and where possible to meet with their offender face to face including victims attending Youth Offender Panels. 

Over recent years victim engagement has resulted in direct reparation being undertaken such as gardening work, repairing doors/walls in the family home following criminal damage, making a bird table as a gift for an elderly victim and washing Police cars following criminal damage to a Police vehicle. Indirect reparation has continued to be undertaken where victims did not want direct reparation, but nominated appropriate recipients such as work at the Lighthouse foodbank, the King's Kitchen and Kewstoke Community Farm. Where there are no identified victims, or victims decline to be involved the YOS maintains a range of other indirect projects including an allotment (with produce donated to South West Children's Hospice and the food bank), Horseworld, Holly Hedge Animal Sanctuary, Strawberry Line, various litter picking projects and a variety of craft based projects where items produced are donated to charity shops. One-off projects are also undertaken such as ground clearance of waste land in Clevedon at request of local councillors and recently we have installed no smoking publicity on rubbish bins across the authority completed checks and notices on grit bins in preparation for winter, and helped with work on the Marine Lake at Clevedon. Work has been done to clean the Millennium Bridge and refurbish benches in Congresbury. Following anti-social behaviour in Pill reparation activities have been completed at the Fire Station and following a request from the Parish Council the toilet block at Blagdon cemetery has been renovated.


11. Young Victims' Service

In 2015 North Somerset YOS was awarded by the Office of the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner, after a commissioning process, a three-year tender, extended by a fourth year, to establish and deliver an independent victims service for young people across Avon and Somerset. In 2018 we successfully re-tendered to deliver this Service from 2019 for four years with potential for two further year extensions. In 2018 we submitted a bid to the Home Office to work with young people affected by domestic abuse. This was successful and provides two years' funding to develop the Young Victims Service offer and staffing capacity with this explicit domestic abuse remit. This means - additional to existing 3.6 YVS case holding staff - an additional 4 YVS Advocates, 1 Senior Practitioner and 0.6 Support Worker will be added to the team together with Service Leader, and Restorative Justice and Supervision Manager, time allocated to this remit. Governance is through to the YOS Management Board. To date the Young Victims' Service has been very well received and recognised by a range of Partners as well as the service users. On 11/07/17 the Young Victims' Service secured the North Somerset Council Change and Innovation Award. From 2015 to March 2019, 1581 young victims have been referred from Lighthouse Victim and Witness Care Service and other partners across Avon and Somerset. A separate full year 18/19 report of the Young Victim's Service is available on request.


12. Review 17/18 Against National and Local Indicators
 
12.1 First Time Entrants (National Indicator 111)

Reducing first time entrants into the criminal justice system continues to see a significant downward trend: 292 (06/07) to 45 (18/19) representing a 86% reduction, this reflects the development of youth restorative disposals, community resolutions and the continued YOS and other Partner interventions with young people on the edge of entering the criminal justice system. 7 (15.6%) of the total FTE's were young people known to Support & Safeguarding, Children and Young People's Services, prior to their first conviction and 4 of the 45 had Child Looked After status at the time of conviction. (2017/18; FTE 66 (77% reduction 06/07), 29% known to Support & Safeguarding prior to first conviction, 8 CLA at time of conviction)

For 2018/19, There 116 Community Resolutions were given (2017/18; 55 CRs). Community Resolutions are used as a means of effectively diverting young people from the criminal justice system. 

12.2 Reducing Re-Offending (National Indicator 19)

Re-offending data is collated from the Police National Computer (PNC) and is now presented as a three-month cohort rather than a 12-month cohort, with the cohort tracked over 12 months. Changing from 12-month cohorts to the three-month cohorts results in a greater proportion of prolific offenders and hence higher reoffending rates, though both measures show similar trends over time. 
Suitable comparable areas have been identified on the basis of three economic domains in the deprivation indices of income, employment, and education and skills. The four areas selected are seaside towns within the context of more affluent hinter grounds. 
Reducing re-offending continues to be a challenging indicator. There is a continuing drive to assess methods of intervention to impact specific young people. There is a small yet significant group of young people evidencing high risk scores in relation to a number of axes: personal relationships, lifestyle, substance misuse, thinking and behaviour and education, training and employment. This reinforces the approach to deliver targeted interventions across a range of risk areas.

Nationally there has been a 1.3pp reduction in the rate of re-offending when comparing April 15-March 16 against the same period 16/17, locally there is a reduction of 8.7pp. In 2016/17 the average number of reoffences per reoffender nationally was 3.90 an increase of 3.1% compared to the previous 12 months; locally the figure was 3.00 a reduction of 7.5%. (Refer to appendix v)

12.3 Young People Sentenced to Custody (National Indicator 43)

The cost of custody in social, financial and predicted re-offending statistical trends continues to mean that this will be a focus of activity. To this end the YOS, significantly assisted by the Youth Justice Grant, has focused efforts on alternatives to custody and intensive resettlement programmes. During 14/15 we undertook an analysis of the custodial population in relation to seriousness and gravity of offending and non-compliance; and intensity and type of risk areas to ensure effective delivery of targeted multi-agency interventions. In 15/16 further analysis was considered by the YOS Management Board in relation to drug use across adults and young people.

Since July 2010, the Service Leader, YOS has undertaken the project management role for the South West Resettlement Consortium (sponsored by the Youth Justice Board) - across six local authority areas, currently two secure establishments and incorporating independent sector partner agencies - thus reinforcing and developing service provision for resettlement. Through Independent People 16-25, the ex-Avon local authority areas (members of the South West Resettlement Consortium) have accessed services through the Future4Me Project, April 12 - July 16 for young people leaving Care or Custody in consequence of grant funding from the Lottery Fund. The project won the National Lottery Award 2015 for the Best Charity Project in the United Kingdom. The initial project ran from April 12 to July 16. Subsequently further funding from the Lottery Fund enabled a revised project brief for a further three years from January 2017 to work with young people aged 16-25 leaving care or custody.  

During 16/17 the project, across the four local authorities, worked with 91 young people including 65 new referrals, of which 7 new referrals were from North Somerset.

The reporting of custody for YOTs is shown as rate of custodial sentences per 1.000 of 10-17 population. During 2018/19 the rate is 0 as no young people were given a custodial sentence. 2017/18 rate; 0.16; this represents (3 young people with 3 custodial sentences.) 2016/17 rate; 0.05 (1 young people / 1 sentence).
 
The cost of custodial sentences is met nationally by the Youth Justice Board. The cost of custody for 18/19 is £0.00. (2017/18: 420 days at a cost of £162,088, 3 new episodes, 1 recalled to custody.

13. Young People Remanded to Custody

The YOS continues to work closely with the Courts and partner agencies to deliver robust community programmes and bail packages to promote positive outcomes for young people and the wider society in personal, social and financial aspects. 

As of the 03/12/12 under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 all young people remanded in custody are given children looked after status whilst on remand irrespective of whether they had such status prior to the remand; and leaving care services if remanded for 13 weeks or more.

The cost of remands transferred to the Local Authority from 1st April 2013. The devolved remand budget for 18/19 was £14,198. During 2018/19 there were 0 episodes and as a result no costs (£0.00)
The delegation of the remand budget from Youth Justice Board reinforces the critical nature of the YOS and the Local Authority in constraining the use of remands to custody due to the associated financial costs. 

The devolved remand budget for 18/19 was £14,198 and £104 for 19/20 which means the rolling budget year to year budget carry over - £23,221 deficit in year ending March 19 remains outstanding.

14. Health Provision

Substance use in relation to drugs including alcohol is often a significant risk factor related to offending behaviour including the commission of offences under the influence or possession of illegal substances.

YOS/Substance Advice Service (SAS) workers provide a range of interventions to reduce risk of further involvement in offending behaviour/antisocial behaviour, and to meet their emotional health needs and to promote healthy living and general life prospects. 

The work of the YOS managed Substance Advice Service is highlighted in the Young People's Substance Misuse Treatment Plan and Needs Assessment April 2017 - March 2020. SAS has over a number of years achieved a significant local profile in delivering effective interventions as externally recognised by Public Health England and Youth Justice Board. 

The YOS provides generic health assessments to all young people on statutory orders and on other programmes as required. The YOS has revised the health assessment to all young people on statutory orders and other programmes as required. This has included reworking the emotional/mental health aspects of assessment and in turn the interventions delivered. In this respect we have used the additional capacity through new NHS England/CCG funding to deliver to more young people across Children's Services. We have delivered a whole system approach i.e. through a number of YOS workers. The revised assessment tool and approach ensures an enhanced focus on mental health. Information on throughput and outputs is routinely reported to the Clinical Commissioning Group and NHS England. The performance has exceeded requirements. 


15. Use of Resources

North Somerset Youth Offending and Prevention Service (YOS) is a multi-agency service responsible for delivering specialist statutory and targeted services to prevent offending and re-offending. This includes delivery through Youth Offender Panels, Intensive Supervision and Surveillance, Unpaid Work, community reparation projects in partnership with the independent voluntary sector, Youth Conditional Cautions, Youth Inclusion Support Project, Junction 21 Mentoring and Advocacy Service, Substance Advice Service and services in relation to young people community harmful sexual behaviour including the Substance Use Diversion Scheme. The development of these targeted services has been based on analyses of projected needs and risk to the community. The YOS is involved in significant shared working based on case by case need and risk assessment e.g. with Children's Support and Safeguarding Teams, Resource Service, 1625 Independent People and the High Impact Families Team.

The YOS has been subject to significant reduction of funding over the years. This has been managed through reduction of posts linked to reduction in numbers of young people entering the criminal justice system; and re-deploying staff/staff time to alternative services e.g. 40% of the Service Leader's post apportioned to the High Impact Families Programme and 30% of the Restorative Justice Managers post to Young Victims' Service (commissioned by the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner). The Service Leader, YOS is additionally commissioned by the High Impact Families Programme to provide strategic and operational oversight and input into this programme thus reducing time spent on YOS core business.

As of 31/01/15 North Somerset Council outsourced business support and reception duties to Agilisys. This is shown as a recharge against the YOS £63,707.

The current funding to statutory and targeted core business is from the statutory YOS Management Board partners; Police, Probation, North Somerset Council - Children & Young People's Service (CYPS) and Public Health, Clinical Commissioning Group/National Health Service - England, the Youth Justice Board, and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner. 

Police and Crime Commissioner funding started in 12/13 and is being sustained as a contribution to the YOS's Youth Inclusion Support Project targeted interventions and Substance Advice Service work with monitoring/ reporting against first time entrants, distance travelled tools on those engaged, and substance misuse treatment planned completions. There was a 10% reduction of funding from 17/18.

The "Troubled Families" programme contribute £22,034 to the staffing cost of a Preventative Caseworker (Substance Use) post. The Substance Advice Service Team is thus integral to the High Impact Families Programme offer. 

A 0.5 Education Welfare Officer secondment was ended in March 2018 to achieve £20.5k budget savings towards total YOS £30k budget savings contribution to Children's Support and Safeguarding budget reductions. This post holder had increasingly focused on wider Children's Services parenting cases with the demand for criminally based parenting work being reduced through there being a reduction in demand and parenting support delivered through other process e.g. Youth Offender Panels. This means that parenting assessments, and management of Court orders is now undertaken by the statutory case holders in the YOS. The Restorative Justice and Supervision Manager will continue, on request, to provide a quality assurance and case advice role in relation to assessments and parenting orders generated through prosecutions for non-school attendance, however, the YOS does not oversee this potential area of work This interface supports the close interface with Children's Services and young people evidencing an educational risk factor which is statistically significant to involvement in offending. 

The Youth Justice Board Grant for 19/20 is £239,206 (previously £241,682) including £18,399 (previously £18,574) for the Attendance Centre. This remains the same as 17/18. The Youth Justice Board funds the Intensive Supervision and Resettlement Manager post, 0.7 of the Restorative Justice and Supervision Manager, two Support Worker posts, 75% of the Mentoring and Advocacy Coordinator post; and part of a Social Worker post - the latter through the Attendance Centre funding. All these posts are critical to the prevention of offending and reoffending; and constraining the potential use of custody. 

The Police contribution to the pooled budget in 17/18 was £35,890. After numerous representations, the contribution for 18/19 was nevertheless reduced to £5k per a Police secondee which now means a £10k per annum contribution. This reduction in funding contributed to the need in 18/19 to find additional savings to balance the budget. This £5k per a head mirrors the previous National Probation Service reduction in funding to this level. NS YOS is currently working with the National Probation Service to secure a new probation secondee.

The Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner commissions separately the YOS managed Young Victims Service which also utilises a day and a half a week of the Restorative Justice and Supervision Manager's post, and a recharge against the Service Leader's post of half a day per week.

On 01/10/15 the YOS took on the management and development of mentoring, independent visiting and advocacy for Children Looked After. This extension in services delivered through Junction 21 has achieved efficiency savings through synergy with the existing YOS mentoring service.

This is to fund Court and (i) Youth Offender Panel work, (ii) reports to Court, and supervision of Court Orders, (iii) Out of Court Panel Interventions, (iv) Young People's Substance Advice Service, (v) Junction 21 Mentoring Scheme in relation to mentoring, and (vi) Youth Inclusion Support Project and Victim Contact Work. Therefore, it should be borne in mind that this financial table cannot be compared with other YOTs as it is not comparable in that NS YOS includes (iv), (v), and (vi) as part of its operations. Additionally, and separately, North Somerset YOS is funded by the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner to deliver the Avon and Somerset Young Victims' Service which has been augmented by Home Office funding in relation to domestic abuse provision.

1 25K towards the cost of SAS Team Leader/Mental Health Specialist; and 40K from CCG/NHS - England through the NHS England Health and Justice Collaborative Commissioning Work Stream which agreed to a new post with a mental health focus which delivers across children's services.

2 Contributions include staff secondment costs that remain with the seconding agency. This covers the costs of the Police staff and a contribution to the Partnership budget.

3 Contribution based on Probation Officer secondee being in post for 3 months and £5k contribution to Partnership budget. 

4 This includes £18,399 for the Junior Attendance Centre. 
Evidently the contribution of Partner agencies to crime prevention and safeguarding, outside of that channelled through the YOS, is critical to ensuring effective outcomes e.g. Police, CYPS Community Family Teams and Resource Service in diverting young people from the criminal justice system; housing association provision relating to suitable accommodation; educational provision through schools, academies, and the Voyage Learning Campus; management of transitions with partners in relation to young people in moving into adult services; and the high impact families initiative; the partnership with the Courts and sentencers in the administration of justice and implementation of Court Orders/decisions; and shared resettlement work with the Secure Estate principally HM Parc YOI.

The YOS invests in the recruitment, training and supervision of volunteers who form Youth Offender Panes, mentors and appropriate adults to young people on arrest.  Volunteers both offer an invaluable contribution to services provided and community involvement and ownership of the work of the YOS.


16. Forward Plan 

The YOS is committed to continuous development - this has seen in the establishment of quality assured projects / interventions in partnership with key agencies. The forward plan reflects this commitment and a responsiveness to current national and local drivers e.g. the 'troubled families' programme and reducing re-offending. In North Somerset there is a significant, albeit low number of young people presenting significant risk and vulnerability issues.

The YOS has a well-established, skilled and experienced workforce which has seen the nurturing of strong links with other staff within North Somerset Council and a wide range of partner agencies thus strengthening intervention work with young people and families.

A significant risk for the YOS in 19/20 will be ensuring that all YOS staff are able to effectively deliver in various areas of specialisation, particularly those working with young people on statutory orders made by the Court, bearing in mind a significant turnover in management and practitioner staff. The existing Mental Health Specialist/Substance Advice Team Leader post became vacant from 10/07/2019. Recruitment to this specialist post will be challenging as will the effective management of related services during the vacant period. The YOS has also had since January 2019 reduced workload capacity on Probation Officer secondment ending. 

Earlier numerated areas of activity have been deleted from this three-year rolling plan where the actions have been achieved. Refer to previous Youth Justice Plans for further information.
