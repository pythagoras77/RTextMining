Foreword

The youth justice strategic plan 2019-20 provides an overview of our approach in Newham Youth offending team, and how we work with our stakeholders to meet the three national indicators: 
Reducing reoffending and preventing offending Reducing first time entrants to the YJ system and Reducing the use of custody. We endeavour to work with our partners and residents to ensure that Newham remains a local authority where we can continue to work in partnership to keep children and young people safe, and reach their potential.

Newham Youth Offending team contributes an active role to the multiagency public protection and safeguarding approach   across the partnership. The paramount importance of cross departmental delivery, with a view to enhance a collaborative partnership focus, in ensuring children young people benefit from effective and efficient services. We believe that senior leadership is a significant force for promoting a culture that respects diversity. While constantly promoting this vision themselves, senior leaders of Newham Youth Offending Team expect every employee to embrace the underlying values of this vision and to demonstrate a strong commitment to attracting, retaining and supporting employees who reflect the diversity of our broader society.

The YOT has responded to the numerous drivers for change in recent years and has received a significant reduction in finance year on year and in year cut from the YJB. The priority to protect frontline services continues, however it has been with immense difficulty. The challenges continue to provide a first class service in times of less resources and finances. Encouragingly, the staff team have remained motivated, committed and focused in ensuring that standards of delivery are consistent. 

Introduction 
Newham YOT is a statutory partnership between The London Borough of Newham, Newham PCT, Probation Services and Newham Metropolitan Police. The primary aim of all YOT's is set by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, to reduce offending and reoffending by children and young people in Newham. The YOT undertakes a range of different interventions, including providing support to parents and victims of young offenders, supporting court ordered interventions with children and young people and taking measures to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour in Newham by young people. 
Newham has one of the youngest and most diverse populations in the country. Deprivation levels in Newham are improving. According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2015) Newham was the 2nd most deprived borough in England in 2010. By 2015, Newham was ranked 25th. 73% of its residents are from the Black and minority ethnic groups (BME) and 74% are under-45 years of age according to the ONS 2016 mid year population estimates.
Newham local authority is a transient borough and consequently a high volume of out of borough cases are supervised on behalf of other local authorities. These cases are primarily complex and high risk and are managed in line with national standards robustly and effectively .The cross borough partnership has been of an exceptional standard often responding to dynamic and challenging situations.
Newham YOT functions effectively in both of the two key sectors within which it operates:
* Criminal justice services
* Services for children and young people.
The YOT has a key role to play in supporting the link between criminal justice and welfare systems, and in ensuring that Children and Young People's Framework Partnership provide coherent planning to meet the needs of children and young people before, during and after their involvement in the youth justice system. Newham has a commitment to working together to reduce levels of youth crime and antisocial behaviour.  Enforcement and Safety, Met Police, Educational Services and Safeguarding play a significant role in reducing offending and anti-social behaviour amongst young people.
The plan sets out our key achievements during 2019/20 our priorities for the financial year ahead; how the service is structured and resourced; how we work with our partners and outlines the risks to future delivery. The plan is reviewed annually and monitored by the YOT Partnership Board on a quarterly basis. This is an evolving document and will be reviewed and refreshed annually by the YOT Partnership board to ensure that it is still relevant, captures best practice and sets out new activities in response to emerging themes and trends. 

Our Core Values
It is essential that young people are engaged in the interventions planned for them therefore self- assessment is a central component of the Our Core Values/NEWHAM YOUTH OFFENDING SERVICE (YOS) approach and must be prioritised throughout.
As a Service, we believe our core values of;
?	Respect: demonstrating listening and consideration to each other and service users to our.
?	Aspiration: We encourage and celebrate growth, positivity and achievements.
?	Empowering Culture: Building confidence and trust which enables the team take ownership.
?	Integrity: Engaging with each other fairly and without biasness.
?	Working together: Enhancing individual skills, talent and knowledge  . 
Our partnership with stakeholders, service users and the community is pivotal in ensuring that children and young people of Newham receive services that deliver positive outcomes.
Newham Context 
Newham is a diverse and population-dense borough in the east of London. In the 2011 census, Newham's population was estimated to be 308,000, which was the largest population increase of all London Boroughs, approximately 64,000 people since the previous 2001 census and is projected to rise to 375,500 by 2031 (an increase of 39%). 
Newham has a higher proportion of males to females compared to London. According to the ONS mid 2017 estimates, Newham's population is made up of 52.9% male and 47.1% female compared to London where the gender split is more even with 49.8% male and 50.2% female, see graph 1 below. 
Newham has a younger population compared to London, 24.6% of the population is aged between 0-17 years, 68.1 % is 18-64 years, and 7.3% is over 65. In London, only 13.9% of the population is 0-17 years old, 73.6% is 18-64 years, and 12.5% is over the age of 65.

72.5% of Newham's population are from BAME groups, this is significantly higher than the 40.7% of the population of London that derives from BAME groups. Along the same lines of ethnicity, it is important to note that of Newham's total population 41.4% does not use English as their main language as opposed to the 22.1 % of the London population.
Newham has a lower employment rate at 66.2% which is 6.7% lower compared to London's 72.9%. It is also worth noting that the youth unemployment rate in Newham is 4.1% compared to 3.6% for London. In education, Newham has a 57.6% achievement rate of 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE compared to London's rate of 61.8% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE.

There has been an increase in young people being sentenced to custodial sentences, in response  to the current landscape and sentencing benches adopting a robust approach as part of their sentencing powers . Offences of violence  are generally remitted to the Crown Court who have greater sentencing powers. Given the current landscape, Courts are responding heavily to such offences to deter their commission.

In terms of current offending trends in the borough, there continues to be an increasing volume of young people appearing at Court for Possession of offensive weapons , often this is a first entry into the criminal justice system, with young people citing fear of crime as common explanations for carrying weapons . Of notable concern, are the various types of dangerous weapons  that young people are accessing and consequently receiving custodial outcome at court .The weapons are larger and more dangerous in size than previously, and range from large hunting knives, commando knives, machetes, iron poles .

The gravity scores of the offences, denotes the level of seriousness, these  continue to be consistent with those young people who have been remanded into Youth Detention Accommodation, demonstrating a commensurate approach by Magistrates Courts.

The  over-representation of children and young people from the  Black,  and Asian  ethnicity  within custody continues to be a challenge for Youth Offending Teams  across the country. In response to this theme, Newham YOT have  devised a Disproportionality sub group and delivery plan  whereby multi agency partners collectively contribute to identify and provide a response as part of the approach in  addressing this issue.

Newham Youth Offending Team are committed to reducing the number of young people subject to custodial sentences even though overall custody figures have reduced.  The profile of those young people who are subject to custodial sentences, fit the definition of "Custodial sentences should only be used where it is necessary to protect the public from those whose offending and alleged offending is serious enough to warrant a custodial sentence".

In response to the increase in custodial sentences, the following approaches will be adopted  to strengthen our delivery of services:

* A Reducing Custody  Sub group will be devised as a mechanism to review post custodial sentences assessments to ensure  there is a definitive response  to the salient comments provided by the sentencing benches.
* Ongoing  communication  with District Judges and  Magistrates to provide information and awareness regarding the current landscape and the contributory significant  factors.
* Implement an Enhanced Offer of support to those at risk of custody due to their behaviour and lifestyle, by implementing opportunities to young people in the form of corporate mentoring, employability skills and training, and  narrative therapy to address the impact of adverse childhood experiences.
* Collaborative approach with inter departmental services to contribute to a tailored approach that will assist in providing a stable and safe environment to enable young people to effectively abstain from re-offending.

YOT Demographic Profile:  
Newham YOS's gender is primarily male with 90.4% of the total and in the last 5 years the percentage of Male has slowly increased (graph 1 below).
The highest age group is 17+ years old with 52%; the percentage of young people within the age bracket 10 to 13 years has increased this year 7.5%, which is an increase of 3.4% from last year (4.1%). The percentage of 14 to 16 years olds has also increased this year by 4% (graph 2 below).
According to YJB data Newham has consistently had a higher caseload volume in the last 3 years then both the London and England average (graph 3 below).

        

The highest ethnic group is Black 41%, followed by White (24.6%) and Asian (20.8%), recently there has been an increase in the proportion of Black young people and a reduction in Asian young people. In recognition of the over-representation of Black and Minority Ethnic young people in the YOS caseload, a disproportionality review was conducted locally. This report was used to develop a delivery plan and sub-group. The sub-group is attended by the YOS, Police, Children's Social Care, Education and voluntary sector representatives.

Newham's re-offending rate has fallen from 47.1% in the year 2013/14 to 43.2% in the latest yearly data. It is considerably lower than the London average of 47.5% but slightly higher than the National average of 42.3%.The re-offences per re-offender rate and the frequency rate are both marginally higher than the London and YOS family average. Re-offending performance is closely examined and monitored using a live tracker tool. The borough has identified that the small cohorts of individuals who do re-offend display some common characteristics; they are often not in education, employment or training (NEET) and placed out of borough. A carefully considered NEET offer has been produced. EET performance is particularly positive with 71% of the young offender population in suitable education, training and employment. This reflects the partnership work between the YOS, Education Services, the Raising Participation Team and voluntary sector providers to deliver and provide a personalised and robust offer to young people who are NEET.



Key Achievements from 2018/19
Newham's performance against the three Youth Justice Board national indicators is good. It is generally in line with the London average and in some cases, better than the Family average. This is a result of a combination of focused supervision, effective partnership working, robust quality assurance framework. and reflective practice. Although performance is positive, the cases managed by the YOS are growing increasingly complex and the YOT Partnership Board are acutely aware of the challenge of maintaining and improving the service provided. 

Performance

Newham's FTE rate has decreased in the year 2017/18 in line with the local and national trend. 
    
Newham's re-offending rate is considerably lower then the London average but slightly higher then the National average.

Newham's Custody rate has fallen sharply in 2017/18 compared to the national trend which has seen a very small fall. Newham rate is below the London, YOT Family and ELC custody rate.
    
Newham's ETE rate has fallen in line with the national trend but is above the London and England rate as well as the ELC and YOT Family group's rate. Newham ETE is currently at 64%, better than the London average of 51%

Working Together
?	Improving provision of Restorative Justice and listening to the voice of the Victim.
?	Working effectively with other services and local agencies to achieve Reducing Reoffending, First Time Entrants and Use of Custody.  
?	Workforce: A diverse and stable workforce has been secured with a clear professional development approach. Each staff member has a dedicated work stream lead in accordance to skills, interest, Service and community priorities.
?	Youth Violence Landscape The Gangs and Youth violence landscape continues to be a concern locally and regionally.  Various contributing factors such as housing, transition population and change in demographic are threat to community  cohesion. The YOS is a key partner in addressing the concerns and undertaking a coordination role across the partnership. This ensures all partners (statutory and voluntary sector) contribute and the emerging associated themes are communicated across the partnership.
Intervention & Delivery 
The YOS undertakes a range of different interventions, including providing support to parents and victims of young offenders, supporting court ordered interventions with children and young people and taking measures to prevent crime and anti social behaviour in Newham by young people.
The YOS has devised an in-house programme of interventions, tailored to young people at risk and subject to statutory court orders. The interventions are diverse, dynamic and creative and utilise a range of engagement mechanisms to enhance communication and provide safe spaces for young people to express their thoughts/views and feelings. These interventions are enhanced during the school holidays to ensure greater structure and routine is adopted. Provision is delivered from the YOS building and in venues across the borough. The interventions are tailored, reviewed and evaluated by  service users and partner agencies . In response to an emerging cohort of younger people entering the  criminal justice system, the interventions have been divided to ensure the younger age group are receiving support and guidance suitable to their age and level of maturity.
. 
The Youth violence landscape continues to be a concern locally and regionally. The YOT is the lead key partner in addressing the concerns and undertaking a coordination role across the partnership. This ensures all partners statutory and third sector contribute and the emerging associated themes are communicated across the partnership.
Newham YOT continue to participate in innovation in a bid to impact upon the effects of Youth Violence in the borough. A present challenge is addressing the risk posed by cross borough gangs where membership is formed of young people from multiple local authorities and having a coherent approach to monitoring, engaging, supporting and taking enforcement action on those individuals given the responsibility from multiple local authorities in taking necessary action. Newham YOT staff have also delivered training to Magistrates and Judges at Stratford Youth Court in relation to knife crime and weapons offending. The aim of the training was to give the judiciary greater understanding of the context in which much of the present weapons offending sits which will aid their understanding of the young people before the court, Pre-Sentence Reports and aid their decision making. This was as a result of the sharp rise in young people coming to the attention of the Police, YOT and Court with no history of concerns in relation to their conduct, their education, prior offending or concerns about violence.
There is an emerging cohort of young people with complex needs who are less resilient to being involved in further crime and ASB and there is an overlap between this group and those young people who are gang involved.  Additional support is beneficial from an earlier stage than solely the point of exit.
Assessments of young people's problem solving, numeracy levels, verbal reasoning levels and their ability to work with others are used to design effective interventions. During creative and interactive sessions, young people co-design programmes and encourage young people to achieve objectives and overcome the stigma of offending and unemployment
The YOT continues to offer a diversionary and out of court disposal (OoCD) intervention for young people and their families who have been referred by the police following an arrest for a low gravity score offence for the first time.  Type of offences includes theft, criminal damage, possession of cannabis and low level assault.  Alongside this the YOT offers an intervention for young people arrested for the first time for possession of offensive weapons, some of which are found within schools
After a slight increase in FTE during 2016/2017 Newham's FTE rate per 100,000 youth population has fallen in the year 2017/2018 in line with the national trend and this has continued in the year 2018/19. The highest category of offence for FTEs is Knife or Weapons related offences and the majority of these crimes are school based weapons incidents.
The Youth Offending Team has continued to forge ahead with the objective of resourcing parents/carers with information and develop their capacity to parent effectively and build resilience.   In this reporting period there have been particularly challenging and complex family or community dynamics, which the YOT has lead with engaging parents. Parents have traditionally made their presence felt in the criminal justice system during court proceedings or when enforcement action is called upon as part of our community intervention. As alluded to above the nature of the work this period has taken a significant shift and demonstrated our capacity to partner and tailor the intervention to the needs of the parents/carers. The YOT Parents Event has a standard aim of fostering quality and timely communication with parents and carers, ensuring they are aware of resources and themes of concern that effect young people and families locally. It is notable the YOT has been active in supporting our partner agencies access parents in a range of settings.  Our relationship and experience ensured the voice of parents are being utilised in shaping future service delivery.    
The YOT makes direct use of the data from the Disproportionality Toolkit and reviews how this data correlates to young people in custody, missing/without education or training and known to Children Social Care.  This data may then be used to ensure programme delivery is relevant to YOT service users. Disproportionality sub group YOT staff has compiled an in-house BAME/Disproportionality self-awareness and personal development programme.
Trauma Informed Interventions and Assessments Approach:
The Trauma Led approach within the service is a partnership approach, devised to address the increase in complex cases and the impact of adverse childhood experiences, young people are demonstrating through their behaviour. There are various mechanisms in place to evidence this as part of the case management approach , as an effective mechanism to engage young people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event.
Our Service Priorities 

?	Keeping Children and Young People Safe  to address all forms of exploitation within a contextual framework.
?	Engaging with Parents and Carers - mobilising the community.
?	Participation and Engagement - evidencing the  voice of the young person 
?	Restorative Justice (RJ) - Voice of the Victim.
?	Disproportionality  exploring culture and identity and impact within the youth justice system.
?	ETE/NEET offer is devised to ensure aspirations remain a significant feature for young people.

Structure and Governance



The YOT Partnership Board oversees the strategic operation of the YOT in Newham. This board meets quarterly, reports to the Community Safety Partnership and is chaired by the, Director of Commissioning (Health, Housing & Social Care).The Board is attended by all key statutory partners, and has been expanded to include representative's form Public health. The Board provides strong leadership and scrutiny; overseeing the work of the YOT and ensuring that YJB Grant conditions are met. The YOT data is scrutinised quarterly against the YJB indicators and ensures practice is underpinned by changes in government legislation. 
The Board monitors local service performance data (national standards for Youth Justice and quality assurance data) on a monthly basis and performance against national indicators quarterly. Consideration of wider data available to the partnership, such as trends relating to age, gender, ethnicity and the borough's crime profile informs service development and strategies for the deployment of resources to prevent offending and re-offending. 
Newham has a commitment to working together to reduce levels of youth crime and antisocial behaviour.  Enforcement and Safety, Met Police, Educational Services and Safeguarding play a significant role in reducing offending and anti social behaviour amongst young people.
The YOT sits in the enforcement and safety directorate and is line managed by the Director of Enforcement and Safety. The Enforcement & Safety Division works in partnership with other agencies to provide a response to crime, antisocial behaviour and environ-crime issues in the borough. This incorporates an enforcement capability, delivering support to those suffering the effects of crime and anti-social behaviour, as well as an investigative arm securing evidence and intelligence to inform ongoing crime and anti-social behaviour issues. The Head of Service attends Children Social care Management meetings. 
The Board supports the YOT in overcoming barriers to effective multi-agency working and ensures that partner agencies make an effective contribution to delivering against the three Youth Justice Outcomes. Newham Local Authority is undergoing a transition, and as part of this restructure , the YOS will be moving to the Children and Social Care Directorate . The YOS head of service will be responsible for the YOS , and additional  services . The move will enhance the integration of the YOS within a safeguarding system, and provide a seamless connection as part of the integrated response approach .

The youth justice grant is made under section 41(5) of the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act whereby the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (YJB) has authority to make grants, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to local authorities or other bodies to develop good practice and commission research.
This is a challenging financial time for the YOT. Due to efficiencies both in local authority and YJB grants there have been a reduction in resources. It will be necessary for the YOT to prioritise its intervention focusing on the reduction of reoffending and reducing custody. A review of current service provisions is continuous to ascertain whether diverse methods of working would be more productive and efficient for young people and their families
The YMB monitors the YOT budget and expenditure to ensure that services training are delivered within the allocated budget and the YJB conditions are complied with. 
Funding from National probation service has changed in line with national agreements. The NPS will no longer second an additional Probation Officer to the YOT 2019/20. In addition, we have experienced significant challenges in recruiting to a seconded probation officer, and continue to experience  this cohort as prevalent within the YOS.  


Key areas for improvement 2019/20
* Acknowledging SEN is a gap, Newham YOT has developed a SEND delivery plan as well as a sub-group which includes partners from the PRU and the Educational Psychology Team. SEND legislation work with Send Service to ensure that young people who have identified educational needs receive appropriate provision in line with the Send legislation
* Reducing Custody meeting the national indicator has been challenging. The complex nature of thesis cohort is to ensure that the post custody approach is embedded. 
* Service user participation -  improve the service user feedback and communication for those young people subject to statutory orders , and voluntary engagement, and as part of the exit strategies 
* Family engagement - working with our partners to improve primarily our offer to parents /carers
* The link between the MARAC and front line workers needs to be strengthened
* Restorative Justice   enhancing and encouraging victim engagement will continue to be a significant focus, to provide awareness to young people as part of their learning journey to understand the impact of their behaviour  the voice of the victim 
* Keeping Children & Young People safe  - a collaborative approach  to  removing structural barriers to enable our younger generation to consider tools as mechanisms to be  aspirational  
. 

Emerging Practice:
We will be progressing the Signs of safety model as an  opportunity  for children/young people, parents/carers to come up with their own ideas on how to make their children safe before we offer/impose our own solutions.  This approach is enhanced in response to the current youth violence landscape.
Partnership Arrangements:
Effective partnership working arrangements are fundamental to the delivery of the Youth Justice Outcomes. The YOT Management Board provides strong leadership and multi-agency scrutiny which ensures that partnership working is at the heart of both strategic and operational delivery in Newham. 

The Youth Justice priorities are linked with a number of other local partnership arrangements:
* The Community Safety Partnership
* Newham Safeguarding Children Board
* Health and Wellbeing Board
* Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements
* Multi-Agency Risk Panel
* Multi-Agency Gangs and Serious Youth Violence Group

Priority focus for the Community Safety partnership includes Youth Crime. The Community Safety partnership co-ordinates multi agency action to reduce crime and anti social behaviour to develop a safer community. The YOT is a pivotal partner in contributing to tackle crime and disorder and improve community safety. In 2014/15 the volume of offences, where the offender is a young person reduced by 10 (9%) against a target of 10%.



The Board's new priorities for practice development in 2018/19 are:

1.	Criminal Exploitation of Children and Young People
2.	Supporting and Safeguarding Children Affected by Parental Mental Health
3.	Child Neglect


Collectively, as a partnership there is much to be proud of but also clear that there are considerable challenges, particularly those relating to supporting the increasingly complex needs of those children who find themselves within the youth justice system. It is clear much more needs to be done to ensure the consistent safety and welfare of children and young people in the youth justice system and to improve their long-term outcomes. We will continue to work to ensure that the voice of children continues to be at the heart of what we do.
