1. Introduction 
Solihull Youth Offending Service (SYOS) is a multi-agency service which consists of the Local Authority, West Midlands Police, Probation and Health.  Solihull YOS is a specialist service based within the Childrens Services and Skills directorate of the Local Authority.  The team reflects the make-up of these statutory partners and members come from a diverse range of disciplines. The primary aim of the service is to prevent and reduce youth crime across Solihull, delivering the following objectives: 
* preventing and reducing offending
* reducing reoffending
* increasing victim and public confidence
* ensuring the safe and effective use of custody

SYOS works in collaboration with key partners that contributes to positive outcomes for young people, safeguarding the public and protecting the community. This is achieved by all partners ensuring that:
* children and young people are safe and free from harm
* all services recognise that children and young people entering the criminal justice system lead complex lives
* there are appropriate and timely assessments, planning and  interventions 
* the joint vision of prevention and early intervention is supported by all partners and is closely aligned to the West Midlands Police's Child First, Offender Second Strategy




























2. Delivery Priorities 2018-2020
* Priorities for 2018-2020 were identified following a needs analysis using Solihull local data, mapping the gaps and the needs of vulnerable young people at risk of entering the criminal justice system and following partnership consultation.
* Solihull YOS produces a two year plan which outlines the delivery priorities for 2018-2020, as such this plan will continue to deliver against the priorities as identified in the 2018-2019 plan.
* In addition to this the YOS will continue to deliver against its national priorities as outlined by the Youth Justice Board and also introduce a wider understanding of the child first, offender second principle.
* Following the engagement day and changes to YOS standards, two of the priorities have been refined.  This is reflected in priorities three and four.  Priority three has been broadened to encompass the overall emotional wellbeing of children and young people that enter the criminal justice system or are at risk of entering the criminal justice system.  Priority four has been refined to encompass the work required to prepare and implement the new national standards and inspectorate framework. 

Priority One:  Deliver on key national priorities including  
1a - Reduce FTE's into the CJS
1b - Reduce Reoffending 
1c - Maintain the low numbers of young people entering custodial sentences
2 - Combatting disproportionality 
Priority Two: Strategic and operational pathways outlined and implemented to support young people at risk of criminal exploitation therefore improving the outcomes for young people entering the criminal justice system 
 Priority Three: Championing improved emotional wellbeing and mental health outcomes for young people in the youth justice system drawing on effective practice principles, psychological theory based on trauma, abuse, loss, attachment and resilience to improve outcomes for young people within the youth justice system
Priority Four: Implement and monitor the governance arrangements of the Youth Offending Services including robust performance oversight and championing of lead themes through board members relevant to youth justice through the new national standards and HMIP frameworkPriority Five: Increased victim satisfaction through the offer of restorative practices 




3. Context 
Solihull is a small Metropolitan Borough Council within the West Midlands region. Solihull YOS is within the boundaries of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner.  The most recent Joint Strategic Needs Assessment 2018-2019 outlines in the following.  
(Solihull Joint Needs Assessment 2018-2019)

The 2017 statistics that Solihull's population of children and young people in the borough was at 20,774.  The Youth Justice Board redefined new family groups drawing on the Department for Education (DFE)'s Children's Services Statistical Neighbour Benchmarking Model as a guide.  The new family group includes:

* Stockport* Vale of Glamorgan* Trafford* Warwickshire* Essex* Hertfordshire* Leicestershire* Bracknell Forest* Hampshire* East Riding of Yorkshire

4. Performance Summary April 2018 - March 2019
The Youth Offending Service reports on three national indicators including: 
* Reduction in first time entrants 
* Reduction in the rate of proven reoffending
* Use of custody following sentencing 

4.1. Overview 
* Solihull YOS continues to see a declining trend in the number of young people entering the criminal justice system between April 2018 - March 2019. Across the West Midlands Region, Police and Crime area, and amongst the family group Solihull YOS performs consistently well at reducing first time entrant, rate of reoffending and low use of custody.  Whilst Solihull starts from a low baseline current investment into practice development has supported staff to develop their approaches and understanding into the needs of children.  

* YOS Officers have invested valuable time to seek further understanding into strength based approaches such as the Good Lives Model, adverse childhood experiences and trauma informed practices.

* As part of the statutory remit in preventing offending, the YOS also offer voluntary support to young people at risk of offending.  Referrals for this support from external agencies remain consistent (Graph1). During 2018-2019 the YOS extended the preventative offer to provide intervention for young people in receipt of a community resolution as outlined in the 2017-2018 Youth Justices Plan. 

* The number of young people receiving community resolutions also remains consistent to previous years.  The YOS also provides a service to prevent young people from entering the criminal justice system within two area's, prevention and community resolutions. 

* Emerging trends in crime types of offences committed during 2018-2019 are similar to those reported in 2017-2018 these are:
1. Violent Crime
2. Theft/robberies
3. Drug related offences 

* The data set below now also reports on disproportionality within Solihull's youth justice cohort.  The finding outline there is a concerning over representation of mixed race males within Solihull's demographic in comparison to the predominant white male cohort.

* Finally an increasing cohort of young people was assessed as having one or more emotional and or mental health need.  

4.2. First Time Entrants (FTE's) to the Criminal Justice System
* The data for this indicator comes from the Police National Computer and is published by the MoJ for Jan 2018 - Dec 2018. The data is shown in rolling full-years for the 12 months to March, July, September, and December of each year.
* The data set (table 2) outlines a 45.6% reduction in first time entrants by 6%, equivalent to 21 fewer young people. 
* Solihull has remained well below the local and national average for FTE's (graph 2).
* The success of this reduction is primarily the embedding of a child first principle by the police and other local partners.  Young people in receipt of a community resolution are provided support and intervention to desist them from offending.  This intervention would also provide a reason for the  reduction in FTE's:

> Op Intercept
* Targeted activity to address Anti-Social Behaviour and summer demand, in the summer of 2018. Young persons across the  three localities were identified as requiring a more targeted approach by local neighbourhood officers, based on ASB history / periphery of offending & criminality. 
* There was a tiered approach to this activity- warning letters/ ABAs/ ABCs/ law enforcement
* Local officers also conducted targeted patrols in parks across the NPU where there has been ASB and Robbery offending taking place and reported.
* Op Intercept activity has taken place  in summer 2018, October 2018, November 2018 , March 2019  and the policing tactics have now been embedded into 'normal policing business' on the local policing area.
* From a Youth Offender management perspective, there is joint working between police and YOS staff over the summer period.

> Mischief Fortnight
* This is a Force wide initiative with partner agencies and key stakeholders to address Anti- Social behaviour during the October half-term and ties in with Bonfire Night and Halloween.
* Mischief Fortnight activity is well embedded across the local policing area, with engagement with the Local Authority (Parks/ Trading Standards etc..)
* Focussed and targeted policing activity takes place annually.
* From a Youth Offender management perspective, there is joint working between police and YOS staff over this period (October- November).

> Op Sceptre  (Knife Crime week)
* This is a National initiative that all police forces in England and Wales take part in.  There are numerous policing tactics that are used and activities that take place with Force departments and locally with Partner agencies ( Local Authority/ Trading Standards/ Schools).
* Knife crime weeks have taken place:
W/C 18th - 24th  September 2017
W/C 12th February 2018
W/C 17th - 23rd September 2018
* From a Youth Offender management perspective, there is joint working between police and YOS staff during Knife Crime weeks ( police inputs at Schools/ PRUs; Use of Street Doctors programme to give inputs to young people associated with knife crime).

> Project Guardian
* The Home Office released £65m from a budget of £100m to 18 police forces based on hospital admission data not crime data.
* Project Guardian is the WMP response to receiving central government funding to tackle serious violence within the under 25 year age category, with the emphasis on knife crime. It is a 2 year project, of which there are four strands:
* Suppression
* Intelligence
* Investigation
* Diversion
* The remaining £35m is for police forces to set up Violence Reduction Units (VRUs) based upon the Glasgow approach. This includes diversionary activities  and community activities.

4.3. Reoffending rates
* In 2017-2018 the Youth Justice Board changed the methodology for measuring reoffending, with a move from a 12 month cohort to a 3 month cohort in line with adult measures for reoffending data. Nationally, this change results in a greater proportion of public offenders and higher reoffending rates. For Solihull this outlines a reduction in the reoffending rates, as demonstrated below: 
o Below is an overview of the two measures provided by the Ministry of Justice and a third local reoffending rates collated by using the live tracker tool
o Overall local reoffending data highlights a significant reduction in reoffending (page7-9)
o The data form the MoJ is 2 years old due to the way in which the data is compared year on year
o Table 3 shows the twelve month reoffending data and outlines an increase in reoffending for the number of young people within that cohort that reoffended after twelve months 
o Table 4 shows the three month reoffending data outlines a decrease in reoffending for the number of young people within that cohort that reoffended after a three month period
o Table 5 shows the live  tracker reoffending rate 
* The adjustment from 12 month cohorts to the 3 month cohorts results in a reduction of the overall reoffending rate for Solihull during the baseline provided by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). It is essential to note however the timescales of the data being tracked.  
* The data provided by the MoJ is inclusive of young people who have also transferred into adult criminal justice system from the Youth Offending Service to Probation and Community Rehabilitation Companies.
* The Youth Justice Boards live tracking tool was introduced to Solihull YOS in July 2016, therefore we are unable to identity the nature of reoffending for the cohort above.  Moving forward the live tracker tool will provide such information.
* The data presented in this report outlines all three data sets to provide a year on year comparison over the two year plan.

4.4. Twelve Month Reoffending Rate
BaselineCurrent		Jul 15 - Jun 16Jul 16 - Jun 17Number in the cohort 15-16Number of reoffendersNumber of reoffencesReoffences per reoffenderReoffences per offender% ReoffendingNumber in the cohort 16-17Number of reoffendersNumber of reoffencesReoffences per reoffenderReoffences per offender% Reoffending115461192.591.0340.0%8114372.640.4617.3%																				Table 3 	
* Comparing the twelve month data set 2015-2016 against the 2016-2017 data set as outlined above in table 3, the 12 month data outlines a reduction of 22.7% in reoffending from 40% to 17.3%.  The data above outlines a reduction of 34 young people within the cohort, with 14 young people having reoffended committing 37 reoffences.


4.5. Three Month Reoffending Rate
BaselineCurrentApr 16 - Jun 16Apr 17 - Jun 17Number in the cohort 2016Number of reoffendersNumber of reoffencesReoffences per reoffenderReoffences per offender% ReoffendingNumber in the cohort
2017Number of reoffendersNumber of reoffencesReoffences per reoffenderReoffences per offender% Reoffending237101.430.4330.4%16341.330.2518.8%Table 4
* 	The three month data set above outlines a 11.6% reduction in reoffending between April to June 2016 and 2017.  The data above outlines a reduction of 9 young people within the cohort.
* Over the three month period in 2016 there were only 7 reoffenders committing 10 reoffences against, 14 reoffenders committing 22 reoffences the previous year (2015), resulting in a decrease in reoffending by 13.4%.


4.6. Solihull YOS Liver tracker reoffending rate  
*  Following the implementation of the live tracker tool in July 2016, the Solihull reoffending rates are indicated as follows:

YOS LIVE Tracker (Quarterly Data)CohortRe-offendersRe- offences by reoffender% Re-offendingApril 17 -Mar 18 (Cohort tracked until 30/03/19)119123710.1%April 18 - Mar 19  (Cohort tracked until 30/03/20)7091512.9%															Table 5 
* The live tracker allows the YOS to track rates of reoffending in the present, enabling a more responsive approach to addressing reoffending trends and delivery of appropriate programmes outlining a 12.9% reoffending rate for Solihull.
* Reductions in reoffending can be assigned to the YOS undertaking significant amounts of work to ensure that young people are supported to desist them from offending.  Such examples includes; attendance at YJB practice development forums  and Assistant Team Managers ensuring the service is informed of emerging effective practices.  YOS Officers have undertaken training in trauma informed approaches; permission to build strong and effective relationships, continuous improvement of ASSET Plus assessments.  
* The service ensure that practice development meetings are held regularly embed effective practice.
* In addition there are on going plans to ensure that interventions are reviewed with a 'what works' psychological approach to support desistance. 
* Of the 9 young people that reoffended 4 young people committed offences of the same seriousness, including drugs, robbery and theft; 3 young people committed the more serious offences such as violence against the person, theft and robbery, and 2 young people committed an offence of the less seriousness. 

4.7. Use of Custody following Sentence 
* Solihull YOS continue to see very few young people sentenced to custody. It is widely recognised that the use of custody should be limited, with only those young people who are deemed as violent and dangerous within the community serving custodial sentences.
* Young people entering custody from Solihull during this period committed violent and dangerous crimes including, possession of an offensive weapon, section 18 wounding with intent.  

5. Key risks
* Further analysis into the reoffending rates in Solihull has highlighted the following themes as shown in the two charts below for out of court and statutory disposals
* The top crime type for out of court disposals and statutory offences are consistent with the data set for 2017-2018 which is of violence against the person.
* Some differences then apply in the preceding 2.  For out of court disposals these are, theft and handling and drug related offences. 
* Graph 3 outlines the breakdown of offence type for out of court disposals.  This shows an increase in the percentage of young people committing violent offences, specifically against the person.  49% of all out of court offences are, this is 17% increase in this offence type.  However this increase in percentage is a result of the reduced cohort size comparatively between 2017-2018 and 2018-2019.  In 2017-2018 46 young people committed violent offences, in 2018-2019 this reduced to 36 young people within the overall cohort committing this type of an offence.
* Graph 4, outlines the breakdown of offences for statutory orders. 11 out of 37 young people committed offences classified as violent crimes.   The preceding two within this category are, breach of order for 6 young people that have failed to comply with the youth rehabilitation order - the highest community order, and motoring offences equating to 4 young people which is committed with other offence types including violence against the person, robbery or theft.  

5.1. Demographics 
















Mid-year population based on the 2018 data for 10-17 year olds is 20,858. Solihull population of young people that have received support from Solihull Youth Offending Service including statutory and prevention services was 5.9% (per 1,000)



* The demographic of young people in the criminal justice system remains consistent to previous years, white males, aged 16 & 17 years of age. Previously the YOS reported the predominant cohort as white, males aged 15.  Whilst this is still true for prevention cases and out of court disposals this shift to 16 - 17 year olds for statutory cases. 



* The three maps above outline the geographical location of where young people live who the YOS has supported.
* Prevention - over 50% of young people open to the YOS through prevention programmes are based in the North and live in areas of Solihull that fall within 10% of the most deprived neighbourhoods within England and 25% live in areas in the least deprived 50% decile for Solihull This is typical of the demand that Solihull see for services that are thought to be associated with deprivation and heavily weighted to North Solihull. 
* However, for OOCD, (inclusive of youth cautions, youth conditional cautions and community resolutions) just over 50% of young people live in the 50% least deprived and over 25% in the most deprived decile for Solihull.  Unlike Prevention service users however, the map identifies clusters of where young people reside as opposed to being randomly distributed.  Further analysis will be required to understand the profile of this cohort and the percentage that do not go onto reoffend.
* Statutory clients - this shows young people, including those that are deemed as looked after child that are open on statutory orders to the YOS.
* The data above enables the YOS to support locality developments.

5.2. Disproportionality 
* A key area of concern for Solihull YOS is the number of young mixed race, males that are over represented within the criminal justice system in Solihull. The graphs below show a comparison of the ethnic composition of YOT population (young people who received a youth caution or court conviction) with its region and with its local 10-17 population (2011 census).
* Chart 1 and 3 shows a comparison between the proportion between the White ethnic group with the BAME group at the YOS and region respectively. 
* Chart 2 and 4 shows a comparison of the ethnic groups that are used to make the BAME group at the YOS and region respectively. The BAME group contains data from all ethnic groups (Asian, Black, Mixed and Other). 
* At Solihull YOS White young people are under represented and BAME young people are over represented when comparing the offending population with the 10-17 population.
* White young people make up 75% of the offending population and 85% of the 10-17 population.
* BAME young people make up 25% of the offending population and 15% of the 10-17 population.
* The most over-represented ethnic group are Mixed young people.  They make up 14% of the offending population and 5% of the 10-17 population within Solihull. 
* The YOS cohort also sees an overrepresentation of young people within the youth justice system that have identified emotional and mental health needs.  Out of the number of young people that engaged with a health assessment (72 in total), which includes 100% of young people on statutory programmes, 45% were known to SOLAR, 36% were in receipt of an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) with further 9 young people being identified as requiring an Education, Heath and  Care Plan.  The most common conditions include; anxiety, ASD and emotional and behavioural issues wellbeing. 


5.3. Addressing the needs of young people to prevent offending and reoffending 
* The performance data presented above replicates national trends and concerns of an increase in complex young people entering the criminal justice system. 
* Whilst the YOS maintains consistent reductions in offending and reoffending the changing demographic of the cohort is of concern with a greater concentration of 15 year old males within the system. The challenges for the YOS and its partners will be to offer early intervention services to young males at risk offending especially those who can be identified as demonstrating violent behaviour.  The YOS has prioritised a review of its interventions, working in partnership with Educational Psychologists to ensure interventions are supported by 'what work's theory and proven desistance evidence base.  
* The YOS is also exploring contextual safeguarding implementation and transitional safeguarding as part of a wider Children' Service review to ensure that front line officers develop their practices in line with the needs of young people and their families.  
* A recent report produced by Head of Service for Alternative Provision identifies the same vulnerable young people are at risk of entering criminality through being exploited into county lines and criminal/wider exploitation. In order to address this a working group has been established and successfully bid for Early Intervention Youth Funds via the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner to offer intensive support to young people at risk of offending within the PRU.  This programme will be in operation until March 2020 when the funding will come to an end. The working group, which is led by the YOS is well supported by the Police and Education partners and continue to provide oversight of the project.  The funds have also provided training opportunities for the provider via WM PCC, this has been invaluable.  
* The working group has now expanded its partnership to collaborate with other key partners to apply for the Youth Endowment Funds.  Partnership includes, Childrens Services including the YOS, Public Health, Safer Communities, Education Services including Educational Psychologists, Alternative Provision and the Police.  
* Solihull YOS continues to work in collaboration with other YOS's across the region and West Midlands Police to develop a strategy and interventions for young people committing driving offences a viable alternative to criminalisation whilst still holding them accountable for their actions.



6. Young People's Feedback 
The YOS is committed to service review based on feedback from young people and their families.  In February 2019 the YOS held an engagement day with service users.  In addition the YOS commissioned Urban Heard to undertake consultation with young people who attend the Pupil Referral Unit on their views of their community, safety and wellbeing and their fears. These views have been captured below: 



























Feedback from young people
Young people were invited to an engagement day to in February to share their view of the service and their experiences with a view to inform continuous development.  The young people spent a whole day with the YOS undertaking a number of different workshops.  Young people were asked about their views on the following areas:
* Interventions including individual and group work
* Perceptions of the police (led by the Youth Crime Officer)
* What they would like more information on 
* The best and worst experiences with the YOS
* How the YOS has supported them to keep out of trouble 
* How the YOS has supported them to value their identity
* Support they wish to seek from their health assessment (led by the Specialist YOS Nurse)
* Perceptions on family involvement 
* Perceptions about the information that is provided to them
* Being contacted by Social Media 

The young people received the day very well, with excellent levels of engagement.  Below is an example of some of the comments made in respect of the above.  The full account can be accessed here.

8. Partnership Arrangements

Key YOS relationships have been developed to ensure the young people who enter the criminal justice system are fairly safeguarded and receive the right support based on their rights.  In order to develop a greater understanding of this approach the YOS has: 
* Committed to undertaking a child first, offender second approach by developing links with Birmingham University to enhance the knowledge and the evidence base to the approach
* Attendance at the Youth Justice Conference
* Collaborative working arrangement with other services within the Directorate Children, Education and Skills including Family Support Services, Exploitation Team and Looked After Children Service  including the development of exploitation pathways, developing close links with the multi-agency safeguarding hub and close collaborative working with the Pupil Referral Unit
* Supported key streams of work via the Association of YOS Manager 
* Committed to championing the needs of young people at the Senior Leadership level within Children's Services 
* Successfully developed the working relationship with Children's Commissioning Service to secure future funding from the Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group for the post through SOLAR Emotional Welling Service for Children and Young People
* Developed links with YOS Heads of Services from the West Midlands region
* Developing links with schools via the Police and School Panel meeting

In April 2019 Children's Services launched its latest structure called Family Support Service.  This incorporates the former Engage (Early Help) service and the Children's Assessment Team and Children in Need Team (from the social work service).  To ensure there is a continuation of effective joint working practices the YOS will be involved in a number of workstream to review current pathways and identify and establish new/more effective pathways.  These workstream include:
* Review of pathways and better working practices with the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH)
* Review of pathways into Family Support Service with a direct referral pathway into Family Group Conferencing
* Better established pathways with the Exploitation Team
* Strategic development and implementation of Contextual Safeguarding across Children's Services
	
To ensure improvements impacting the delivery against the youth justice outcomes the YOS is also aligned to key partnership boards including:
* Safer Solihull Board
* Local Safeguarding Children's Partnership
* MAPPA Strategic Board, Local Reducing Reoffending Partnership  via regional representation
* Chanel Panel, with The YOS Manager servicing as Deputy Chair to the Panel   
* Exploitation Panel 
* Risk Management and Offender Management Groups 
* Regional Head of Service YOS representation  
* Out of Court Disposal Scrutiny Board
* Representatives of Association of YOS Managers 
* Solihull Locality Partnerships 

9. YOS Performance against Local Safeguarding Board Partnership Priorities

The Youth Offending service is committed to supporting the aims of Solihull Local Safeguarding Board Partnership (LSCP).  

* Like many other specialist services the young people entering the Youth Justice System lead complex and troubled lives. In order to support and achieve the aims of the LSCP the YOS offers preventative (early help) and statutory support to young people who are:
o Children in Need
o Looked After Children  
o Young people known to CSE services
o At risk of offending 
o Engaged with the wider prevention agenda
o At risk of or entrenched in wider exploitation 
o Probation - VISOR and MAPPA

a. Solihull MBC Governance 
The Youth Offending Service continues to be based within the Children's Services and Skills Directorate:  
* The Assistant Director - Children, Young People and Families is responsible for the Youth Offending Service 
* Monthly Senior Management Team meetings are held inclusive of the Heads of Children's Social Work Services and the Head of Safeguarding 
* The Youth Offending Service Manager is supervised regularly by the Assistant Director for Children's Services with annual appraisals being undertaken within this
* The Manager of the Youth Offending Service has strategic and operational responsibility across the whole service ensuring there is effective management and oversight of the service
* The YOS Management Board links with the Local Safeguarding Children's Board (LSCB) and the Safer Solihull incorporates the YOS remit within its strategic threshold document

b. Structure
* YOS sits as a specialist service directly under the Assistant Director of Childrens Services. This has meant a greater influence on the whole of the Childrens Services agenda with YOS issues raised and considered at a higher level.

* The service has increased its throughput of staff from 13.5 members which includes seconded staff, to 14.2.  The service has seen two sessional workers leave the service and replaced by 2 fixed term staff members that were recruited following successful funding application to the Early Intervention Youth Funds. This is also in addition to a 0.5 FTE fixed term Restorative Justice Worker Post.


11. Resources and value for money 
* Solihull YOS continue to provide value for money through the effective multi agency partnership arrangements supporting young people from desisting into criminality as outlined in the performance data above.
* In addition the YOS has seen an increase to its budget since the previous year's budget allocation, some of these costs relate to cost of living but also funds awarded through successful grant applications to the Arts Council, Police and Crime Commissioner, and the Home Office Early Intervention Youth Funds.

* This contribution represents the costs of seconded staff into the YOS and therefore the costs may vary year to year based on the number of hours the staff member sis contracted to

* Following the retirement of the YOS Specialist Nurse, the SOLAR Emotional Wellbeing Service have agreed to host the post due to the increase in the number of young people that have undiagnosed with emotional wellbeing and mental health concerns.  The increase in staffing costs is reflective of these new arrangements. 

* The Local Authority budget has increased by 30%, less £69,000 which has been deduced for overheads equating to a 10% overall increase for cost of living and regarding programme.

* The Youth Justice Grant denotes a 0.94% decrease in funds to all YOS's.  The Youth Justice Board will draw on this decrease in funds to support front line activity in the form of targeting improvement within youth justice services amounting to an additional 2% directly into front line activity.

* The funding from the Police and Crime Commissioner includes funds awarded following successful application to the Early Intervention Youth Fund (EIYF) of £74,000.  The EIYF was a joint bid submitted through wider consultation between the YOS, the Secondary Pupil Referral Unit and Safer Solihull.  

* Solihull YOS has also seen an increase in funds from the Youth Custody Service to support young people remanded in custody.  Whilst the allocated funds are not stretched enough to cover the costs of remands that Solihull YOS has, it does offer some support to previous years significant shortfalls.

* A £20,000 ring fenced grant has been awarded by the Arts Council and Police and Crime Commissioner to facilitate a Summer Arts Programme for Children and Young People at risk of offending.  This project will be delivered in collaboration with a voluntary sector partner in July- August 2019.

* Key risks to the YOS budgets planning forward include:
o Changes to funding formulas primarily from the Police.  The police have notified YOS's that 2019-2020 will be the last year that they provide funding outside of staffing costs. From April 2020 these funds will be assigned to YOS's based on a funding formula via the Police and Crime Commissioner
o Changes to funding arrangements from Probation
o Sustainability of grant funding such as the Early Intervention Youth Funds
o Policy change leading to reduction all funding contributions across the grant




12. Risk Levels of Future and Service Delivery ActionOwnerHigh RiskChanges to legislation and grant funding * To ensure regular updates between Childrens & Skills Services Directorate and the Board and fit within the wider Children services agenda
* To scope, consult and develop model of sustainable service to support desistance of young people from crimeYOS Management BoardDisproportionate increase of service users into the criminal justice system * Monitor rates of Black, Asian, minority ethnic young people into the youth justice system and the proportionality against convictions 
* Monitor number of young people entering the criminal justice system with SEND YOS Manager
