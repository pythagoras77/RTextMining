A	INTRODUCTION
Lewisham is a vibrant and dynamic borough. Lewisham is a part of London and one of the most diverse local authority areas in the country. Lewisham's 13.4 square miles are criss-crossed with some of the region's busiest roadways and rail networks providing transport routes to and around the capital for people from all over the south-east. In terms of connectivity, Lewisham is just five minutes from London Bridge and 15 minutes from Charing Cross. 

Lewisham is home to over 306,000 people. In terms of population size, it is the fifth largest Inner London borough and the 13th largest in London. Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the population of Lewisham increased by some 30,000. By the time of the next Census in 2021 the population of the borough is forecast to reach 321,000 and 357,000 by the time of the 2031 Census.  Lewisham is comprised of some 133,000 households (forecast to reach 139,000 by 2021 and 156,000 by 2031).

In terms of the demographic profile, children and young people make up about 25 per cent of Lewisham's population, whilst those aged 65 plus comprise some 10 per cent. Over the years Lewisham's population has become increasingly diverse; currently some 54 per cent of residents describe themselves as White, compared to 46 per cent who are of Black & Minority Ethnic heritage. Residents from more than 70 nationalities, covering five continents, make their home in the borough.
Nearly 212,000 Lewisham residents are of working age (16 to 64), of which some 60 per cent of those in employment travelling outside the borough each day to work. Within Lewisham, the borough's employment rate of 80 per cent is above the London and Great Britain averages (73.7 per cent and 74.5 per cent respectively). In terms of occupations, a higher percentage of Lewisham residents (57 per cent) are employed in managerial, professional, associate professional and technical occupations compared to London (55.1 per cent) and Great Britain (45.6 per cent).
There are strong partnerships established over many years in the Borough which provide a strong foundation for effective working as well as constructive challenge of services and response.  The approaches taken in Lewisham in respect of Public protection and safety are amongst the best in London and the country including the model for Missing, Exploited, trafficked children, the work on County lines drug dealing and the Trauma informed approach both within Youth Offending and the community setting.




 
Adults and Young People



Lewisham Borough Young People Profile 
* Some 25% of Lewisham's total population is comprised of children and young people aged 0-19 years.
* Lewisham's population is able to celebrate 160 different languages spoken by children of school age. 
* Some 66% of Lewisham residents aged 0-19 are of BME heritage. This compares to some 76% of the schools population and 46% for the borough as a whole.
* Lewisham ranks 19th nationally (out of 326 local authority areas) for 'income deprivation affecting children', with 1 as high deprivation.
* 156 young people aged 12-18 entered the youth justice system in 2016/17. This represents approximately 0.7% of the age group population. 
* 60% have significant speech and language concerns.
* 86% of CYP in the Youth Justice System have experienced Trauma (HMIP 2017).



In the period 2017/18 Lewisham Youth Offending Service undertook a major review based on the HMIP findings in 2016. During this year the following achievements have been accomplished:

* The recruitment of an experienced and credible independent chair who is also chair of the London YOS Assistant Director Network. The attention to good leadership and governance can improve outcomes for Children and Young People; and retains accountability for reoffending and reducing risk. The Board is now able to evidence improvement using annual self assessments of Board effectiveness .The membership and attendance of the Youth Justice Manage Board (YJMB) illustrates ownership at high Strategy level results in an increase in a widening of the partnership influence on key performance outcomes. The YJMB Performance Sub-group allows partnership work to focus on data and operational collaboration where activity is directed by the main board and in turn drives improvements.

* A comprehensive Service re-modelling using the approaches successfully tested by the South London Resettlement Consortium (2014-1017). Lewisham YOS is now described as a 'Trauma-Informed Service' (Department of Education - Innovation Unit). 81% of young offenders have experienced trauma or adverse events (HMI Probation). The team has received extensive training for staff including handling vicarious trauma, and the secondment of a clinician to provide clinical supervision and transformational practice development. Complementing and linking the Trauma Informed response the team has been developing restorative practice which allows a specific focus on an incident to achieve learning and shift from shame therefore contributing to greater capacity to process Adverse Child Experiences (ACEs). Also complementing the strengths based model is the think family approach with a tiered offer of support and the development of Functional Family Therapy (Lewisham YOS is an accredited FFT Agency).   Board have also undertaken training on the trauma informed approach and also a session with partners to address Unconsciuous Bias

* A full Service re-design moving from a generic team to functional model of team delivery; benefits achieved so far:

INTAKE: ALL Court and First contact work (new Pre-Sentence reports, Out of Court Disposals and remands)
* Increased contact, restorative enquiry and engagement in Pre-sentence report stage 
* Increased screening and assessment for identified needs (Child Criminal Exploitation, Speech and Language and other educational disability, and mental health).




                         INTERVENTION 1: Community Orders, Interventions 
* More targeted, evidence -based and Trauma informed interventions 1-1 and groups
* Programs that are more consistently applied based on what works

INTERVENTION 2: Custodial sentences and high risk including Intensive Surveillance and Support (ISS)

* Closer operational activity with police and Serious Youth Violence Teams to manage high risk cases.
* Enhanced ISS provision as a direct alternative to custody.
* Increased contact with young people in custody, joint work with the institutions and work on pathways to effective resettlement in the community.

Over the past year the Service has been following a partnership action plan focussing on performance information for Children and Young People, improving recording and evidencing of outcomes and ensuring the Service undertakes systematic review and implement changes accordingly. Examples of such reviews are the Joint Service Needs Assessment (JSNA, Health), Group and Individual eEfective practice interventions and a comprehensive revision of all major policies (Workforce Development, Equal Opportunities, Domestic Violence, User Participation and Engagement and Joint Working: YOS &Children's Social Care) 

In addition to the attention to structural and cultural change there has been a significant drive in the Service's ability to collect, analyse and present relevant performance data. A Live Re-offending Tracker was introduced to produce data on all those who receive a substantive outcome from Jan 17 to Dec 17. This enables us to understand key re-offending characteristics, and direct partnership reviews and activity. A good example of the application of the information obtained from the Live tracker is the data obtained on young people known to the service who are identified as having Special Education needs. These individuals are 3 times more likely to re-offend and 4 times more likely to have Domestic Violence as an adverse child experience. Another example identified is that 12 individuals are responsible for 34% of all the re-offending. 

The Improvement Plan for 18/19 has been agreed and achievements during 17/18 were signed off and rated by the board. The top three achievements highlighted are:
* Trauma-informed practice: Lewisham YOS is recognised by the DFE as 'a trauma-informed service meaning it is a relationship and trauma based model delivered as a direct intervention and as a workforce development program.
* Lewisham YOS is now a Functional Family Therapy Community agency accredited to deliver the program on sight.
* The Service re-design has already demonstrated service improvements in Assessment, Planning and Interventions to manage risk and improve outcomes for young people.
 The new Plan has been streamlined with 8 key recommendations and 32 actions for the partnership. The clarity of the relationship between the two boards, the ability to capture and share data and information and the potential to escalate any concerns from the sub-board to the main board have all been included.

Supporting the communication strategy for the partnership is the Lewisham YOS Storyboard (see supporting documentation below). This outlines the key messages and narrative for the Youth Justice Partnership to enhance understanding of the activities, methods and outcomes that we are achieving. There is also a longer version available electronically which additionally provides: 
* A summary of all revised polices and other key related wider partnership strategies
* YOS work flow and process diagrams/infographics
* Logic Model charts
* A summary of the new HMIP criteria and domains. (See appendix 1)


B	STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE

Lewisham YOS is positioned within the Crime Reduction and Supporting People division of Lewisham Council's Directorate for Community Services. The division aims to reduce crime, disorder and substance misuse in Lewisham, in partnership with other agencies. Most of its functions involve the exercise of statutory responsibilities. The division is currently subdivided into the following service areas 
 
* Crime, Enforcement and Regulation Service (which includes Neighbourhood Community Safety Service, Serious Youth Violence, CCTV, Public Health and Nuisance, Licensing and Trading Standards)
* Environmental Health
* Youth Offending Service
* Supporting People and Drug and Alcohol Services

In setting the 2018/19 direction of travel for the Safer Lewisham Partnership, and approach that challenges, ensures that issues are not normalised and asks the difficult questions to tackle the hardest issues has been adopted.  

There are a number of drivers for the approach which include:
* The London Mayors Police and Crime Plan 2017-2021, which has been adopted by Lewisham as the 4 year statutory Strategy.  (Strands of which include A better police service, A Criminal Justice System for London, Keeping children and young people safe, VAWG, Hate crime and Counter Terrorism).
* Regional work being undertaken in respect of the London Landscape, devolution options and future projections in respect of harm and vulnerability and any regional and sub-regional commissioning across agencies.
* Reviews in respect of disproportionality and cohesion including Baroness Young, MP David Lammy, and Dame Louise Casey.
* Findings from reviews being undertaken by central and regional government and partners including MET Police drugs strategy, London VAWG refresh, DIP review, IOM review, Youth Custody prison reform etc. 
* Inspection outcomes and identified learning from Domestic Homicide Reviews and Serious Case reviews  that relate to the Partnership 
* Information from our local strategic needs assessment,  Local residents survey and Lewisham's Local Assessment Profiles (LAP)


Borough partners and residents have identified the following as being essential for our collective approach:
* Reduction in harm and vulnerability being critical as part of an overall prevention, intervention and enforcement approach 
* Reducing fear, harm and revictimisation is critical
* Considering contextual and geographical risks
* Improving trust, confidence and satisfaction 
* Considering systemic approaches that link to agency changes to improve outcomes and impact.
* Using data and analysis which is single, collective and cumulative whilst also considering future foresight modelling.

For 18-19 the Safer Lewisham Partnership seeks to answer further the following:  
* How do we become a less violent society? 
* How do we shape a safer place and space?
* How do we understand and ensure negative bias is reflected upon and protected against?
(See Appendix 3)

The Lewisham Youth Justice Management Board is responsible for the work of the Youth Offending Service and the wider crime prevention partnership. Following the conclusion and proposals for change outlined in the HMIP report the board has undergone a complete review, including the introduction of an independent chair. The Chair has introduced the following new components:
* A self-assessment framework to evaluate effectiveness for participant members.
* A revision of the terms of reference for both the Quarterly Main board and supporting Performance Sub-board.
* Activities outside of the meeting to strengthen Strategic and Operational working to improve ownership of Youth Justice Priorities across the partnership.
* Lead Board member for each section of the improvement plan and clarity of responsibility for implementation. 
* The introduction of a Principal Policy Officer to act as Clerk for the meeting, co-ordinate actions and support the YOS Strategic Manager to update service policies.
* The Board is required to monitor the performance of the prevention of youth crime agenda and ensure the delivery of statutory principal aims at local level. This includes reducing the likelihood of reoffending by young people and the risk of harm that they can cause to other people and themselves. 

The Board undertaook a through review of the first year of the Improvement Plan, set revised actions and approved these in May 2018. This work is reflected in this Youth justice Plan. 
 
The Lewisham YOS Performance Sub-board is responsible for monitoring objectives linked to performance indicators, measures and outcomes, within the national framework established by the Youth Justice Board, as well as other locally agreed priorities. Key statutory requirements include data collation, analysis, completion of national standards audits and other reviews. 



 The YOS has a place at the following Boards and Forums:
* Safeguarding Children's Board (and relevant subgroups including Early Help Strategy Board).
* Multi-Agency Public Protection Strategic Management Board 
*  Risk Management Group including Child Sexual Exploitation and Missing Persons
*  Integrated Offender Management. 
* Safer Lewisham Partnership Board and relevant sub groups

The YJMB has prioritised the collection, analysis and application of a dataset to evidence progress in the HMIP Improvement Plan (see below with current RAG ratings):

Data and Performance Outcomes:

As at July 2018 the 3 KPIs remain RED and Lewisham is rated in the top 5 in London for all three.  However, the live tracker predictions are indicating reductions in all three in terms of numbers. For FTEs the live tracker is more difficult to predict, since the MOJ calculate the number based on per 1000 of the population, whereas the live tracker simply uses numbers of young people. 



First Time Entrants: 
 



 January 2017- December 2018 FTE Data




In 2018 (Jan 18- Dec 18) we are able to compare equivalent months and quarters



In November 2017 29 agencies attended a conference chaired by the YJMB chair to work with partners specifically on tactics to reduce further the First Time Entrants to the Youth Justice System. Highlighted was the 97 Children and Young People Lewisham would have to reduce in the next year to reach the national average. The focus was on:
* What do we know about the Young People (characteristics) entering the system?
* What could we do better?
* What more can the partnership do to prevent criminalisation and offending?


The subsequent FTE partnership plan has resulted in:

> A new framework for working with Youth First (Lewisham's Youth Service) including the provision of the Universal Schools Safety Program (USSP) for year 7 pupils. 
> The inclusion of reducing First Time Entrants as a key indicator for the Children and Young People's Plan.
> A strengthening of the relationship with Compass (the Children and Young People's health service), which includes a health and wellbeing program for triage cases.
> A widening of the brief for the NHS England-funded Liaison and Diversion project, with all young people who are arrested having contact with YOS staff at the police station or  court as the new aim.
> Training across the partnership on Unconscious Bias, which recognises that decision making at early stages of development and other important transitions contributes to over-representation and disproportionality.
> Continue to widen opportunities for Restorative Justice in schools and other important environments.
> The YOS/CSC LAC interface sub-group to address factors that pre-dispose Looked after Children and Young People to criminalisation and over-representation. 
> More community-based parenting support 
> The revision of the schools Knife Crime Protocol
> An increased attention to Speech,   Language and Communication Needs (SLCN) to build increased awareness and capacity to support.
> Further development of the community trauma model targeting specific locations to create safer spaces
> A new narrative for understanding and communication on violence and the public health approach to reducing incidents of violent behaviour.
> Strengthening links to Early Help and preventative strategies
> Enhanced understanding of the role social media plays in influencing young people 
> Making sure we routinely obtain the views of Children and Young People for co-production and review e.g. 'Ask, Listen, Act' (ALA).



Reducing Re-offending

The 2017 and 2018 full year cohorts are being tracked for rate of re-offending on a monthly basis. 


* Percentage re-offending (25%)
* 12 young people have committed 34% of the re-offences
* 42 of the total have a LAC status at the start of the Order
* 78% are from non-white population
* 20% are female
* 21% - 55 witnessed domestic violence
* 7% - 18 were identified as SEND
* Of these 86% witnessed domestic violence and 35% re-offended

Reducing Custody: 
The partnership undertook a review of the custody cohort in early 2017 due to concern about the numbers and comparatively high rates compared to statistical neighbours. Identified were a number of factors including levels of serious violence, group offending and lack of programs and capacity in the YOS, especially in relation to ISS. As a result the following actions were undertaken:
* A review of the PSR quality assurance process, to remove negative bias and become trauma-informed.
* Increasing capacity of Intake team to undertake comprehensive assessments and screenings for vulnerability and safeguarding needs (e.g. CSE, RJ, SAL, Diversity)
* Formal discussions with Bromley Youth Court to introduce the Lewisham YOS Trauma-informed and restorative model. 
* A comprehensive review of the Victim Liaison Service provided by Lewisham YOS
* Intervention Team 2 (high risk cases)  increased its resources to deliver ISS 
* Launch of the  borough-wide county lines toolkit and partnership activity which focussed on protective measures to  safeguard children 
* A review of all programs and the roll out of new 1-1 and group interventions including the piloting of a trauma- informed weapons and violence reduction group
* A partnership approach to Resettlement and an enhanced offer to children leaving custody 

The result has been a significant reduction in custodial sentences (as per the 50% reduction seen on the Live tracker chart below). For example, there were 25 custodial sentences in March-June 17, and only 3 in  in  March-June 18)




C     RESOURCES AND VALUE FOR MONEY

The number of young people that Lewisham YOS works with has reduced over the past five years, but the level of complexity, risk and vulnerability has continued to increase. As of June 2018 the YOS is working with the following cohort of young people, which is broadly representative of the past twelve months: 
256 young people were worked with by the YOS on Out of Court disposals or Court Orders. 
* 22% are Out of Court Disposals ( Triage and Youth Conditional Cautions)
* 80% of the cohort are male
* 70% of cases have committed offences of violence or drugs ( possession and supply)
*  Most young people are sixteen and seventeen, with an increasing number of eighteen year olds subject to youth Orders
* The ethnic breakdown of the young people is broadly reflective of Lewisham's youth population, except when considering the young people in custody, whereby young men from Black and Mixed Heritage backgrounds are over represented. 
* 20% of young people are LAC: 12% are Lewisham LAC and the remainder are placed in borough from other areas.
* Between 50 - 60 young people are NEET at any one time 







The Delivery Model-Trauma-Informed Practice: The Service is progressing the approach to embed and integrate across every element of the work. The roll out of the Case Formulation (Co-production) model has commenced and is currently being tested on 10 high risk cases. . 

Case Formulation: This is a multi-agency case reflection meeting which is conducted following sentence. It is the critical analysis and joint action planning, (the bridge between Assessment and Planning) which ensures agency roles and responsibilities are clear and that there is an agreed 'product' to share with the young person and family. 

The staff team continue to receive one-to -one clinical supervision. The management team have participated in an Away Day with the clinical psychologist to reflect on the progress in moving towards a trauma-informed service.  It was recognised that there is still a long way to go in terms of embedding the approach consistently so that practitioners are able to 
apply evidence, method and outcomes. Lewisham YOS' Trauma-Informed service offers: 

>          Consistent and meaningful contact and trusting relationships
> 'Voice' of young person heard
> Removal of bias labelling and re-victimisation
> Moving to secure, organised attachments
> Reducing fear through reduced stress/anxiety
> Partners co-delivery of the approach
> Monthly 1-1 clinical supervision for staff
> Co-production and case formulation
> Intensive and consistent practitioners
> Interventions that process trauma to manage behaviour 



Restorative Justice: The service continues to lead the roll out of RJ across the partnership. Restorative Now are currently engaged in a whole school approach at Abbey Manor College Pupil Referral Unit providing peer training, twilight sessions, and coaching.  Staff from the school have also attended a crossagency three-day training event, together with CSE police officers, representatives from Lewisham Childrens' homes providers (reducing criminalisation) and new YOS staff. Followup coaching and buddying will be provided as part of the integration of skills and also the potential for a network practice forum between participating agencies.

Unconscious bias: All Team members have completed a series of one-day joint training sessions with the Crime Enforcement and Regulation Team on increasing awareness and understanding bias in its many forms. This was followed up with the provision of further training days for the wider partnership during May/June 18.  A whole YOS team follow-up exercise has highlighted that there are many positive approaches that are used across the work streams to address negative bias (Court reports, interactions with young people, Restorative and TI approaches) but also much more that can be achieved using the 'Identifying the potential bias at each stage' framework seen below:

 Reflect, Reframe, Redirect
- Challenge without shaming
- Check response and reflect with colleagues
- Examine cultural assumptions
- Use the GRACES as a framework (Gender, Race, Religion, Age, Ability, Appearance, Class, Caste, Colour Culture, Sexuality, Spirituality, and Sexual Orientation. 

User Engagement: Ensuring the views of Children and the Community are heard:

The Lewisham Youth Offending Service wants to embed a culture which recognises learning across all levels of the service and values the importance of the voice of the child. This is more than a response to the legal requirement under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and is about ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights, specifically through Article 12 which states that 'children have the right to participate in decision-making processes that may be relevant in their lives and to influence decisions taken in their regard'. It is a belief that children and young people (CYP) aged 17 and under should have opportunities to express their opinion in matters that affect their lives. To do this we need to create opportunities for CYP to play meaningful roles at an operational level, as well as in decision-making structures and thereby making young people part of the governance arrangements. 

We believe that every person working with children, young people and families, from senior managers to frontline staff have a role to play in participation. The everyday practice for staff should be to support CYP to have a voice. Listening to CYP is not an 'add-on' to programmes or work activity. Participation is not achieved in one-off surveys or meetings; it is part of an ongoing process and practitioner 'mind-set' that establishes and utilises good lines of communication between those who provide services and those who use them. 

Our vision is for the YOS to be a service where CYP feel that their views and experiences are encouraged, valued, respected and most importantly acted upon to shape services that meet their needs.  Examples to date have been:
* Focus groups to consult on Referral panel 
* Advice and input into Trauma-Informed Violence Reduction Program
* Young person participation in Youth Justice Management Board engagement session



                                               Listen        Hear            Act


A Rationale for Change: Lewisham YOS has experienced a significant reduction in budget since the last restructure in 2013. In 2017 the business case was made to fund an increased capacity in the YOS to implement  the service re-design and the enhanced requirements arising from the HMIP Improvement Plan, which resulted in four growth posts (I x Operational Manager and 3 x Youth Offending Officers). We have also benefitted from the commissioning of an independent Board Chair and Consultancy post. Although the council is unable to approve a permanent £250k growth the service is able to continue with these additional posts for next year assuming income does not fall. Lewisham YOS is always running with an over spend on the remand budget. This was devolved to local authorities in 2013 due to high numbers of young people being placed into custody prior to sentencing, for r serious or persistent offending. As a result of this, there will be a shortfall of £301k based on predictions for remand overspend.


Partner contributions to the youth offending partnership pooled budget 2017/18


Staffing accounts for 90% of annual expenditure across the service each year with only a small number of contracts and external services provided. For 2018-19 this will include: 
* The Appropriate Adult Service
* Young Lewisham Project (reparation)
* The Conservation Volunteers (reparation)

Lewisham Youth Offending Service works within the financial regulations of Lewisham Council. These ensure that all expenditure is commissioned in a fair and transparent manner and expenses are made in line with the relevant funding grants. All expenditure is overseen by the Youth Justice Management Board; daily management is delegated to the Strategic YOS Manager and monthly finance meetings take place with a nominated Council finance officer.

Effectiveness informing decision-making: Lewisham YOS has trained staff in the use of Project Oracle and the Theory of Change. Each team has a Logic Model and set of RAG rated outcomes to drive performance improvement (See Appendix 3??). The Operational Managers use these to engage their staff in ownership and achievement of positive outcomes.

Lewisham YOS has a dedicated Functional Family Therapy (FFT) team, which forms part of a joint approach with Children's Services to reduce offending and reoffending. FFT is for families whereby a young person (aged between 10 and 18 years) is involved in serious delinquent behaviour and/or substance misuse. Its primary aims are to reduce youth offending, substance misuse and out-of-home placements. Young people will typically be referred into FFT through the youth justice system.  

In order for FFT to be considered clinically successful, there needs to be a critical change index of 4.63 for 'Family Functioning' and 4.43 for 'symptoms'. Our Clinical Feedback System data shows the following scores below:

Youth Family Functioning Scores (COM)

PrePostChange Index15.8226.2 

Caregiver Family Functioning Scores (COM)

PrePostChange Index15.822.48.6

Youth Symptoms 

PrePostChange Index413011

Parent Caregiver (report in Youth's symptoms)

The above data shows that Lewisham's FFT treatment leads to a 'significant improvement' for families resulting in enhanced Family Functioning (e.g. a reduction in blame, better communication and conflict management within the family) and a reduction of adverse youth symptoms (e.g. getting into trouble, low mood, wanting to run away from home etc.)

It may also be argued that offering FFT to families in a preventative capacity is contributing to the YOS' reduction in First Time Entrants (FTEs).

D            PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS
Lewisham Council has an overarching vision for the borough which informs everything it does: 'Together we will make Lewisham the best place in London to live, work and learn'. The vision is shared with key partners and the Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) outlines how all partners will work towards the vision by contributing to six key priorities. The Council, in turn, has developed ten corporate priorities to articulate its contribution to the SCS and these priorities form the heart of strategic planning.

The Safer Lewisham Partnership 'Safe' Plan 2018/19 identifies 3 overarching priorities for the partnership:

1) How do we become a less violent society?

Exposure to and actual violence impact significantly on communities and individuals.  Violence covers serious youth violence, peer on peer abuseand gender-based violence including domestic abuse. These crimes are high harm and contribute significantly to all crime borough-wide. 

2) How do we shape a better place and space?

Research has gradually evolved to recognise the role that contextual, as well as developmental and familial, factors play in the process of adolescent development. The social spaces where young people spend their time is a key area of consideration when developing approaches.  

As young people explore and assert their independence from family contexts during adolescence, the relationships they form outside of their homes, and the nature of the spaces in which these form, influence their exposure to safety, risk and abuse.

3) How do we ensure negative bias is recognised and acted upon?

A number of reports have evidenced the disproportionate impact on aspects of our community through the Criminal Justice system. It is clear that the language used to describe issues, individuals and agencies needs to be objective and unbiased to ensure that fairness and equality is at the heart of approaches by all.

Social cohesion and integration are at the heart of tackling discrimination, with open and regular community dialogue being crucial.

Key Partnership Arrangements 


 
Joint Youth Offending Service/Children Social Care Policy 2018: The policy has undergone a complete refresh and offers clarity about respective roles and checklists for responsibilities in relation to Community Orders and Custodial sentences. Best practice for preparing young people for release from custody and preventing homelessness and accommodation standards is now aligned between the teams. 

 Exchange of information about serious violence and county lines concerns to formulate collaborative approaches to young people trafficked or exploited through drug dealing: This theme has also been subject to joint service approaches through the Lewisham Safeguarding Children's Board. A joint audit of cases where CYP were Missing, Exploited or Trafficked was undertaken to identify any gaps or areas for improvement.  

A focus on ensuring child placements manage behaviour appropriately and restoratively to prevent criminalisation or escalation of offending: Varying practice has been seen from In-borough children's homes in relation to using the police appropriately and resolving low level bad behaviour without recourse to arrest as well as knowing when to use police intervention.


MET Police: Lewisham Police have remodelled their Integrated Offender Management (IOM) model, embedding the YOS police officers and their work alongside the wider IOM team and Trilogy gang offender team. There are two YOS police officers who deliver their work in line with the Pan London model and have contributed significantly to the improvements in Out of Court disposal practice. The joint partnership activity relating to county lines tracking, the Missing, Exploited and Trafficked Policy and the new Rescue and Response Mayors Office funded project will ensure Lewisham remains at the forefront of best practiceas recognised by the YJB below:






Probation: Lewisham YOS has maintained strong relations across both aspects of the Probation Service - the National Probation Service (NPS) and the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC). An increase in resource from 1 to 1.5 dedicated probation officers will continue in Lewisham under the NPS. The NPS maintain a focus on holding cases and transferring cases to adult services. The probation officers will continue to be part of the YOS team and will contribute to all areas of service delivery and the new Reducing Violence hub. Lewisham and Southwark YOS are working in partnership with NPS on piloting a new transitions program to further improve Youth to adult transitions.






Health: Lewisham YOS has a well-resourced and comprehensive CAMHS Service which is co-located at the YOS. 
The Young People's Health and Well Being Service deliver a range of health support including a substance misuse service delivered by Compass providing holistic support to YOS clients through a local, young person's centre, The Hub.
Following a JSNA in 2017 which was commissioned by the YJMB, new recommendations were included in planning, with the following notable outcomes:
* A range of health screenings across the board including Strengths, Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQs) as standard to identify needs and vulnerabilities.
* The bringing of the Liaison and Diversion post directly into the YOS from CAHMS.
* Service now based around the trauma-informed model health and wellbeing at work including mindfulness and relation for staff




Education: A robust partnership exists across the YOS, the Local Authority's Education Department and local schools, colleges and the PRU. The YOS Youth Engagement Officer is a joint appointment, funded by the YOS and the Education Department and this will continue for 2018/19. 
In addition the YOS will be commissioning a Speech and Language Therapist in 2018/19 to build on the work that has already commenced on improved screening, staff awareness and use of specialist resources (Durham model). The partnership work work recognises the importance of the SEND strategy and clear pathways and arrangements of assessment and planning for children with educational needs.

Key challenges for Lewisham in 2018-2019 (Report by the Independent Chair)

The Boards Improvement Strategy is focused upon gaining better outcomes for young people, families and community. However, some of the key challenges to the work include:
	
1) Prevention work. The YJMB functions are integral to the Safe Lewisham Plan and the Children and Young Peoples Plan. 
* How police and YOS work on joint decision-making
* How locality services work with YOS to divert young people from the Justice System, when that is the right decision. 
* Focus on SEND young people including those already in the Youth Justice system
* Building further capacity at community level
* Further development of FFT and RJ
		
2) Serious Youth violence, as in much of London, is causing a very significant rise in the risks and complexities of cases managed by YOT. The YJMB is fully linked into the "a Safe Lewisham Plan". Trauma Informed approaches to this are fundamental for prevention, enforcement and resettlement work. 
		
3) External preparation preparing for the next Inspection and ensuring both HMIP and YJB are clear on the progress being made and the timeline of improvement remain as priorities.

Underlying all this is a set of actions the Main board is taking to address regarding over-representation of Black Asian and multi-ethnic (BAME) children in the Youth Justice system, in line with our Trauma Informed approach.   

The Board will also need to sustain tight scrutiny of practice, finances, and outcomes.

Keith Cohen - Lewisham Youth Offending Service Manager 2018







1. Introduction and Background:

The number of First Time Entrants (FTEs) entering the Youth Justice System is one of 3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) measured nationally by the YJB. Information is provided from Ministry of Justice (MOJ) via the  Police National Computer (PNC) database and is gathered in rolling full years for the 12 months to March, July, September and December. FTEs are defined as young people (aged 10 - 17), resident in England and Wales, who received their first caution, Youth Conditional caution or conviction. Entrance into the criminal system by a young person may be influenced by a range of adverse child experiences, including lack of education, having a family member or peers who have offended, poor family relationships and support and substance misuse.

While FTEs are a key measure for the borough's preventative activity in deterring children from crime it is also heavily influenced by legislation and police activity.  Over the decade 2003-2013 year on year reductions have been achieved nationally In Police-led diversionary practices and informal sanctions, such as Community Resolutions, the use of restorative justice and triage, may have helped to maintain and perhaps accelerate the falls (particularly in specific types of FTEs - notably children and females who are more likely to commit low-level offences).  Since 2013 it is considered that these reductions have generally 'bottomed out' and the continued reductions are a challenge for youth justice services in an era of high focus on youth crime, austerity and social change. 



The table above shows the current higher level of FTEs for Lewisham compared to the London average and national average over the past 4 years. Although the England average has reduced the London and Lewisham rates have remained remarkably consistent. Lewisham is always in the top 10 highest for London (although there are notable quarterly variations ranging from 2nd to 10th).  At its height Lewisham had 704 per thousand of its relevant young person population Jan 15- Dec 15 compared to lowest 519 Jan 16- Dec 16. For the same period 2017 the Service has used a Live tracker to measure FTEs.


2. Data -the Lewisham Youth Offending Service live tracker: 

There has been a significant drive in the Service's ability to collect, analyse and present relevant
Performance data. A Live Re-offending Tracker was introduced to produce data on all
those who receive a substantive outcome from Jan 17 to Dec 17. This enables us to monitor our KPIs in a more dynamic and responsive way and understand key re-offending characteristics to direct partnership reviews and activity.

In 2018 (Jan 18- Dec 18) we are able to compare equivalent months and quarters



3. 'Reducing the 97 '- partnership plan

In November 2017 29 agencies attended a conference chaired by the YJMB chair to work with partners specifically on tactics to reduce further the First Time Entrants to the Youth Justice System. Highlighted was the 97 Children and Young People Lewisham would have to reduce in the next year to reach the national average. The focus was on:
* What do we know about the Young People (characteristics) entering the system?
* What could we do better?
* What more can the partnership do to prevent criminalisation and offending?


The subsequent partnership plan has resulted in:

> A new framework for working with Youth 1st ( Lewisham's Youth Service) including the provision of the universal schools program for year 6 pupils ( transition from primary)
> The inclusion of reducing first time entrants as a key indicator for the Children and Young People's Plan
> A strengthening of the relationship with the new Children and Young People's health service including a new health and wellbeing program for triage cases
> A widening of the brief for NHS England funded Liaison and Diversion project with a goal of all young people who are arrested having contact with YOS staff at the police station or at court.
> Training across the partnership on Unconscious Bias recognising that decision making at early stages of development and other important transitions contributes to over-representation and disproportionality
> Continue to widen opportunities for Restorative Justice in schools and other important environments
> The YOS/CSC LAC interface sub-group to address factors that pre-dispose looked after young people to criminalisation and over-representation 
> More community based parenting support 
> The revision of the schools knife crime protocol
> An increased attention to Speech and Language and SLCN to build increased awareness and capacity to support
> Further development of the community trauma model targeting specific locations to create safer spaces
> A new narrative for understanding and communicating of violence and the public health approach to reducing incidents of violent behaviour
> Strengthening links to Early Help and preventative strategies
> Enhanced understanding of the role social media plays in influencing young people but also use of media for positive messages
> Making sure we routinely obtain the views of children and service users for co-production and review. 'Ask, Listen, Act' ALA.


5. Out of Court disposals top ten factors to consider

The new HMIP criteria includes Out of Court disposals as one of the three domains for inspection.  Early intervention at the police station and signposting to provision outside the criminal justice system can influence the number of FTEs coming into the system. Lewisham YOS has a OOCDs action plan based on the top ten key questions highlighted below:
