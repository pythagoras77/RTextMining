1. PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
This plan seeks to inform the strategic direction of Oldham Youth Justice Service (YJS) in 2018/19 and outline how it will achieve its primary functions and the identified key objectives and developments.  


The strategic priorities of the service are:

* Preventing youth crime (including youth violence)
* Reducing Reoffending (including the use of custody)
* Safeguarding
* Protecting the Public

These are underpinned by a commitment to 

* Quality Assurance
* Learning and Development
* Partnership 
* Governance


2. INTRODUCTION (INCLUDING PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS)
Oldham is a complex, challenging place to deliver Youth Justice. With a population of 232,724 the borough is considered an area with 'pockets of prosperity' characterised by a burgeoning youth population with 22.5% of residents under 16. There is a high representation of Asian British heritage amongst its diversity, with 10.1% Pakistani and 7.3% Bangladeshi. Levels of deprivation are ranked amongst the highest in the country and average household numbers also higher than national averages. In 2015 Oldham ranked 51 out of 327 local authorities (low being poor) for 'crime score'. 

2018/19 was one of considerable success for the service; an inspection in November found the service to be 'good' with post court work outstanding across the measures. It is particularly pleasing to see that areas of challenge in the previous inspection were found to have been strengthened significantly. There remains hard work to be done and we aspire to be seen as an outstanding service overall at the next inspection.

The attached action plan outlines our response to the findings, but the plans are also evident within the strategic plans outlined. The performance summaries are also very encouraging- Oldham focusses on the underlying causes of offending, neither than the nature of offences and this seems to be having a positive impact on outcomes for children and families. Our work to embed trauma informed practice and contextual safeguarding approaches are key to this and we look forward to continuing to embed and evaluate these programmes of work.

Oldham is one of nine YOTs in Greater Manchester within the North West region. To the best of our knowledge, Oldham YJS is the only statutory YJS in England & Wales which is sub-contracted by the Local Authority and directly delivered by an independent charitable trust - Positive Steps (PS). PS also provides an integrated range of Young People's services, including: Information, Advice & Guidance services; an 'Early Help' offer aimed at preventing young people from entering the youth justice system; a young people's substance misuse service; sexual health services, missing from home return interviews and the young carers' support service. We also deliver a range of family-based services. 

The Centre, through which all these services are delivered, also hosts a range of partner services including: Healthy Young Minds; a generalist nurse and assistant practitioner team; counselling services; housing advocacy and mediation services and the after-care duty team from the Council's Children's Social Care. Oldham is a medium-sized YJS, employing 29 staff and currently has 15 volunteers.  The staff team is a diverse reflection of the community we service with six staff from BAMER backgrounds. 

In addition to our directly-employed staff the YJS benefits from a seconded police officer.  Health services provide a team of staff who assess all YJS clients and provides direct medical support or referral where needed.  The Probation service seconds one full time officer. We employ a Volunteer Coordinator within Positive Steps and within the YJS have a strong volunteer workforce which contributes, in the main, to the work the service undertakes with young people subject to Reparation and Referral Orders. Additionally, we are supported by an education team based within Positive Steps; this ensures full compliance with the Crime and disorder Act provisions.

The YJS has a strong tradition of working effectively with partners at a range of forums including: 

* Children and Young People's Alliance
* Health and Wellbeing Board
* Greater Manchester Senior Leadership Group (GMSL)
* Community Safety and Cohesion Partnership (CSCP)
* Local Safeguarding Children Board
* Drug and alcohol strategic forum
* Teenage Pregnancy and Sexual Health Board
* Greater Manchester Youth Justice University Partnership (GMYJUP)
* Children's Social Care Resource Panel
* Children and Young People's Emotional Wellbeing and Mental Health Partnership
* Corporate Parenting Panel
* Integrated Offender Management Steering Group
* Greater Manchester Youth Justice Strategic Managers
* North West Resettlement Consortium




3. POSITIVE STEPS (PS)
As an independent charitable trust, Positive Steps Oldham (PS) is unique in England in the way it provides an integrated range of support services for young people. Its charitable objectives are:

1. to advance the education and training of young people in order to prepare them for working and adult life; 
2. the relief of unemployment for the public benefit in such ways as may be thought fits, including providing assistance to find employment; 
3. the provision of recreational facilities for young people in the interests of social welfare; 
4. the promotion of public safety; 
5. the prevention of crime and the rehabilitation of young offenders; 
6. advancing in life and helping young people by developing their skills, capacities and capabilities to enable them to participate in society as independent, mature and responsible individuals; 
7. the relief of sickness and the preservation of health among people residing permanently or temporarily in such locations as the Company is commissioned to deliver services; 
8. the provision of support and activities which develop their skills, capacities and capabilities to enable them to participate in society as mature and responsible individuals; 
9. to assist in the treatment and care of persons suffering mental or physical illness arising from substance abuse or in need of rehabilitation as a result of such illness. 






4. STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE
Positive Steps is governed through a board of Trustees comprised of elected members and community representatives. The YJS is overseen by a Youth Justice Management Board which reports to both the Children's Trust and the Community Safety and Cohesion Partnership. Quarterly meetings are held to hold the service to account and performance monitoring is well embedded within these meetings. Performance monitoring includes ensuring that terms and conditions set out in the YJB grant are maintained. The board is active and represents statutory partners but also the wider partnership essential to overcome barriers to multi agency working. 

Youth justice governance principally comes from the statutory functions of the Youth Justice Management Board, recently subject to a change of Chair (Director of Children's Services). Strategic influence and governance is strong; the Director of Children's Services is the lead for youth justice across GM and the Head of Service leads within GM on resettlement, youth violence and evidence-based practice. We are also working alongside Salford to pilot problem solving courts. 2018/19 has seen continued developments in wider policy and governance. Greater Manchester has seen emerging change through the GM Children's Service Review. This work is a reflection of the devolution of power to Greater Manchester in key policy areas, including criminal justice. Oldham continues to work with all key GM decision makers and stakeholders to ensure the quality of local provision is maintained and improved.

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND PLANS (INCLUDING RISKS TO SERVICE DELIVERY)













9. OUR AMBITION FOR 2019-2020
Oldham is working hard to ensure that young people at risk of or involved in offending are given the best opportunities to engage in positive activities and move away from decisions that put themselves and communities at risk. This was clear within 2018's HMIP inspection which found many areas of outstanding practice and noted 'children and young people are at the heart of everything this service does'. We want to build on these strong foundations, ensuring that that the community is safe, and that victims of youth crime and disorder are given a strong voice within the system that can be a central part of diversion and rehabilitation. Through an increased focus on partnership working and an ambitious agenda for change we believe we can build on good performance and continue to improve to deliver these outcomes.

We have set the agenda for 'child first' approaches to youth justice and recent projects and practice in trauma and contextual safeguarding to support diversion and rehabilitation are strong evidence of this work. We will continue to support this best practice and have recently secured funding to deliver specific contextual safeguarding projects in two schools with the partnership support of the local authority, community safety and Greater Manchester Police with external scrutiny and research from the University of Bedfordshire. It is this kind of partnership approach, at the cutting edge of practice, that will allow us to develop improved outcomes for young people and families for 2019-2020.

Youth violence has become a key factor in shaping service delivery in Oldham. Across the community and partnership, the impact of serious violence has been felt over recent years with serious and multi-agency case reviews highlighting the damage caused and sometimes reactive nature of partnership responses. We have subsequently set up a serious youth violence strategic group and redesigned our services to meet acute needs. In particular, we recognise that those involved in youth violence are often not those that are familiar to the justice system and therefore need an improved partnership approach to intelligence sharing and identification of need. Oldham's 'youth panel' is a significant step in attempting to resolve this issue. The development of this approach and associated improvements in directing and targeting resources will be key to an overall strategy for success in incidents of youth violence and general diversion and prevention of offending.

The following plans, based on our key priorities, outline our ambition our commitment to achieving improved performance and outcomes for children and young people.







What will we achieve?
Reduce levels of first-time entrants to the criminal justice system through a collaborative, partnership approach to prevention.

10. PERFORMANCE REPORT 
Performance reports based on the key objectives are provided quarterly to the YJMB and then on to the Children's and Young People's Alliance and Community Safety and Cohesion Partnership.  Reports are also made to the Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB). These reports are used within the YJS Management Team and are shared across staff teams.  

The three main indicators are:

* Number of First Time Entrants
* Re-offending rates
* Custody rates

In addition to the National data set a number of measures are also collected locally for monitoring purposes, included in this plan are the ETE, LAC and ethnicity data which are only monitored locally.

We also produce local 'caseload management' and 'data checking' reports to help Managers and staff to ensure that data accuracy and client contact standards are maintained. 











11. HEADLINE PERFORMANCE




12. FIRST TIME ENTRANTS
First Time Entrants (FTEs) are classified as young people, resident in England and Wales, who received their first youth caution, youth conditional caution or court conviction, based on data recorded by the Police National Computer (PNC). Nationally the Youth Justice Board utilises Police National Computer (PNC) data linked to the offenders' postcodes to report retrospectively on each YOTs performance on a rolling 12-month basis. The indicator measures the rate of first-time entrants to the criminal justice system per 100,000 of 10 to 17-year olds.
FTE PNC Rates 2015 to 2018FTE PNC rate per 100,000 of 10-17 population - Good performance is typified by a negative percentageOldhamNorth WestGreater ManchesterYOT family (New)*EnglandJan 18 - Dec 18254243266272238Jan 17 to Dec 17349260263322296percent change from selected baseline-27.1%-6.3%1.2%-15.5%-19.6%      Jan 17 - Dec 17345257261320292Jan 16 - Dec 16346295338337331percent change from selected baseline-0.2%-13.0%-22.7%-4.9%-11.6%      Jan 16 - Dec 16 346294337261327Jan 15 - Dec 15376340388347373percent change from selected baseline-8.1%-13.6%-13.0%-24.9%-12.2%
Oldham have reduced the number of young people significantly within the last twelve months. The rate is now below comparators, having previously been at a higher level. Continued work within the partnership, and particularly with Greater Manchester Police have helped to support this reduction. We anticipate further improvements through the use of the youth panel arrangements and the developing new out of court framework that GMP are currently implementing. This is particularly encouraging as it is also matched by reductions in reoffending once young people enter the criminal justice system.
13. REOFFENDING
Nationally the rate of reoffending amongst young people is measured using data from the Police National Computer (PNC). 

The rate of reoffending is presented in three ways:

1. A frequency measure of offending - the average number of re-offences per offender
2. A re-offence measure of offending - the average number of offences per young person who went on to re-offend
3. A binary measure of reoffending - the percentage of young people who re-offended
We are pleased to see that all indicators of reoffending highlight progress for the service. Young people are less likely to reoffend and those that do reoffend do so less often. We have focussed within the last twelve months on working to reduce reoffending by focussing on causal and contextual factors, rather than the offence committed. This is challenging work and involved a significant amount more focus on family work and partnership approaches as well as using our developed knowledge through contextual safeguarding and trauma informed practice to support rehabilitation. We are encouraged to see that this approach is making the difference and will be working to further embed this within the next year.

14. CUSTODY
The custody indicator measures the number of young people given a custodial sentence in a rolling 12-month period and is presented as a rate per 1,000 of the general 10-17-year-old population. Nationally the data is collated through the Youth Justice Management Information System (YJMIS) with comparative data available from across all English YOTS. 

Oldham's custody level is roughly in line with comparators, although GM and our family comparison group is significantly above the England average. Serious youth violence is a significant contributory factor to the levels of custody within Oldham. There is a significant amount of focussed work on a partnership basis, through the youth violence strategy, to improve our response to these issues. 

Immediate steps have been taken in Oldham to identify potential serious youth violence at an earlier stage and develop a more robust approach. This includes 
developing improved ways of working through the 'youth panel' to support improvements. Through our contextual safeguarding pilot, we are also looking to develop key learning and improve practice to prevent young people committing serious offences and violence against communities.

15. EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT
The YJS has a statutory obligation to record whether young people completing community and custodial orders are actively engaged in suitable employment, education or training when their order comes to an end. Oldham YJS use this information to inform a local measure of young offender's engagement in ETE. Results are extracted using the local case management system (IYSS). Although ETE case data is also submitted centrally to the Youth Justice Management Information System (YJMIS), the Youth Justice Board does not yet offer comparative ETE data at a national level.
This is an important indicator in measuring the impact of the YJS and partner interventions when young people reach the end of their court order. The ETE outcomes for young people involved in the criminal justice system are a positive reflection of the integrated offer across Positive Steps with excellent links to the Careers Guidance and Support Services which underpin this success.

16. CHILDREN LOOKED AFTER
Local authorities measure the number of young people who have been continuously looked after for a 12-month period and during this time have committed an offence resulting in a court outcome or caution. The results are measured using a rolling 12-month total and presented quarterly. The outcomes are encouraging in that we are below the baseline in terms of children looked after receiving a caution however the broader picture, locally and nationally, is troubling. In Oldham you are over ten times more likely to enter the criminal justice system than the general population. We are particularly focused on improving the partnership understanding and impact of restorative justice to support improvements in this area, reducing instances of criminal charge from incidents in the care home. 

Our systemic approach to both diversion and reoffending should also embed approaches that support more effective outcomes for children looked after, particularly the focus on trauma informed practice and contextualised safeguarding. These are areas that are well supported by evidence of disproportionate impact for these children and young people. We will continue to monitor and review this area through the youth justice management board.

17. ETHNICITY
Several key themes emerge when reviewing diversity and disproportionality in youth justice over the last twelve months. 

* White British children are consistently over represented in the 'pre court' setting
* Asian British young people are significantly over represented in custody
* Mixed parentage children are over represented throughout the system
* Black children are over represented in the post court setting (although with very small numbers)
Work is under way, through a partnership evaluation, to gain a better understanding of why BAMER communities are not engaging in the voluntary offer across the partnership. We are looking forward to receiving this report and implementing an improvement plan based on recommendations. We will continue to track the cohort and evaluate the impact of disproportionality on an ongoing basis.

** Any money from the police and crime commissioner that has been routed through a local crime reduction partnership should be included here.
*** It should be noted that the 'Other' category is for additional funding that the YOT can use for any general youth justice activities. Accordingly, funding such as the YJB Grant for Junior Attendance Centres should not be included as there is an expectation that these streams must be used for the delivery of services as intended, only when this has been achieved can any surplus be reinvested within wider YOT service delivery.
19. RESOURCING AND VALUE FOR MONEY (ALSO SEE APPENDIX 1)
The complexities of YJS funding streams, which identify resources for specific groups of clients, have both enabled us to target resources towards clients with the greatest need, but also allowed us some flexibility with individual specialisms to enable a wider group of young people to benefit from enhanced provision. 
Oldham YJS, being part of an integrated services delivery model, benefits from increased value for money from many of the co-located service areas.  We also benefit from our charitable status and this year have benefitted from additional funding relating to youth violence, mentoring and support for young women which without this status would not have been available to us. 

Oldham's Junior Attendance Centre grant supports a social enterprise project 'Positive Cycles'. The programme works to recycle bikes for those that are unemployed as well as completing repairs and hiring bikes to the local community. The centre is also a local community hub and hosts many health and wellbeing activities across the generations, making it an ideal place for young people to learn skills and broaden horizons.

All organisations face the continuing challenge of maximising resources and demonstrating value for money to funders and commissioners - Positive Steps is no different.  The complexities of the funding streams have both enabled us to target resources towards clients with the greatest needs whilst still allowing flexibility to ensure wider groups of clients benefit from enhanced provision.  Value for money is a significant benefit of the integrated service delivery model with a wide range of co-located services enabling practitioners to provide a high quality multi-faceted service to clients. We benefit from having an internal Business Support Team providing a cost effective, timely and high-quality support service across the organisation.  

The successful Positive Steps Volunteer Strategy demonstrates value for money and offers opportunities for increased integration and mutual benefits across services.  For example, the Volunteers Team provided development volunteering opportunities for clients on Family Support programme and have had 17 clients referred to the volunteering team from Positive Steps. We have had a number of clients who have gained employment who have said the volunteering experience has helped them to achieve this.  

 The organisation provides a unique service delivery model, based on the integration of statutory and voluntary support services for young people. The delivery model allows young people to seamlessly access a range of services through a one stop shop approach and creates considerable efficiencies as a result. The most recent area for development is the newly commissioned integrated substance misuse/sexual health services. Significant efficiencies have been found by integrating these inter dependant services and the model of developing integration should have potential further cost benefits.

INTRODUCTION 

Following inspection in December 2018 Oldham Youth Justice Service received a 'good' overall rating. However, the following areas were identified as requiring additional actions to support improvements: 
Oldham Youth Justice Service manager should:  
 
• make sure that tools used for assessment, planning and decision-making in out-of-court cases enable full consideration of safety and wellbeing and risk of harm to others 
 
• make sure that plans to set up a joint decision-making panel for out-of-court cases are carried out and that all decisions are supported by clear proposals and appropriate plans. It is important that a clear rationale for the final decision is recorded, thereby enabling effective scrutiny and oversight of this work 
 
• consider the needs and wishes of victims in all cases, as well as any risks to their safety. 
 
The Chair of the Oldham Youth Justice Management Board should: 
 
• make sure that statutory Board members attend regularly and that the Board holds the YJS to account effectively for its performance. 
 
The Oldham Youth Justice Management Board should: 
 
• make sure that joint working arrangements between the YJS and local authority children's services are effective including access to relevant records for YJS staff.

27th March 2019 
 
	1 	Purpose 
1.1 	To provide an update on the serious youth violence project funded by the Community Safety Cohesion Partnership Board and the proposed contextual safeguarding delivery model. 
	2 	Theoretical Basis 
2.1 	Youth Now is informed by theory to maximise its effectiveness for a complex, vulnerable and challenging cohort of young people and families. 
	3 	Contextual Approach 
3.1 	In Oldham and nationally, there is recognition of the number of children who are harmed by their peers. The 2013 Crime Survey in England and Wales estimated that children aged 10 to 15 years of age experienced 465,000 incidents of violent crime, 79% of which was perpetrated by someone aged 10 to 15. 33% of young women have reported experiencing sexual violence from a partner before they turn 18 years of age (Barter et al., 2009), and 66% of adult survivors of child sexual abuse have said that they were abused by another young person and not an adult (Radford et al., 2011). 
3.2 	Schools have been identified as environments in which young people can experience and/or be safeguarded from abuse and violence. Contextual safeguarding is an approach that supports practitioners to recognise and respond to the harm that young people experience outside of the home. 

The work of the contextual safeguarding network has informed developments to date within Oldham, in response to youth violence and has been identified as an asset from which to develop more effective practice. Further information can be found at https://www.contextualsafeguarding.org.uk/  
3.3 	Working contextually within the setting will afford practitioners the opportunities to embed a 'whole system' approach ensuring that schools themselves remain integral to the assessment process and intervention planning. The school is the context from which the work will be developed but it is not the only context that the interventions will be addressing. All domains of a child's experience, and the factors that associate with risk of youth violence will be central to practice. These include the domains in Figure 1. The team will draw on a range of interventions, pathways and approaches outlined in Figure 3. 
	4 	Theory of Change 
4.1 	A theory of change is a strategic tool to describe an intervention programme's pathway to addressing its goals. Our theory of change identifies the need for the intervention, Youth Now, which is designed to work with children and families at risk of engaging in youth violence. It identifies the characteristics of the groups of children who will most benefit from engagement, and the target goals and outcomes to be achieved for those individuals and, by extension, for wider society.  
	5 	Profile of Target Group 
5.1 	Our intervention aims to respond to the needs of young people and their families where concerns have been identified and there are clear indicators to suggest a higher risk of becoming involved in violence, both as a victim and/or perpetrator. A key strength in the approach is to promote desistance from offending by identifying and building on current protective factors. Young people will be identified in two schools in Oldham, where the risk of youth violence is identified as problematic.  
	5.2 	The following definitions will be used to identify those most at risk.  
Risk and Protective Factors: 
• Risk factors: are those which can usefully predict an increased likelihood of violence. For example, communities with high levels of unemployment may be at higher risk of experiencing increased levels of violence.  
• Protective factors: are factors that reduce the likelihood of violence. For example, communities with low levels of unemployment may be at less risk of experiencing high levels of violence. 
 	 
6 Desistance Theory and Good Lives Model:  
6.1 "Desistance is the process of abstaining from crime amongst those who previously had engaged in a sustained pattern of offending" Maruna, Making Good, 2002  
6.2 Part of the focus for the Youth Now initiative will be to promote desistance from offending. The team within the schools already have a wealth of experience as they have been seconded from within the Youth Justice Service based at Positive Steps in Oldham. The Good Lives Model (GLM) focuses on promoting individual's important personal goals, whilst reducing and managing any identified risk factors. It is a strengths-based approach focusing on the individual's personal preferences and values and draws upon these to motivate individuals to live better lives. A significant feature of this approach is the development of a 'trusted relationship' between practitioner and the young person/families.  
"The most effective way to reduce risk is to give individuals the necessary conditions to lead better lives ('good lives') than to simply teach them how to minimise their chances of being incarcerated." 
	7 	Public Health Approaches 
7.1 Public Health approaches to youth violence are well evidenced as effective methods of harm reduction. Recent rising levels of youth violence in England and Wales have resulted in additional focus on public health methodology. Public Health advocates an approach that recognises: 
• Addressing violence is not a single agency issue, as it is the culmination of many different issues. It is only by pursuing a strategic, coordinated approach involving a range of agencies, including partnerships between statutory and voluntary organisations, that violent crime can be effectively addressed.  
• As local leaders, councils play a key role in reducing violence, bringing together partners through their strategic and operational role spanning enforcement, early intervention and prevention in relation to violent crime, and provision of support to victims of violence. 
	8 	Serious Violence - Local and National Policy Context 
8.1 While overall crime continues to fall, homicide, knife crime and gun crime have risen since 2014 across virtually all police force areas in England and Wales. Robbery has also risen sharply since 2016.  
8.2 These increases have been accompanied by a shift towards younger victims and perpetrators. For homicide, the rise is being driven by male-on-male cases rather than violence against women and girls.  
8.3 The long-term serious violence trend in England and Wales has been similar to that in other developed nations, many of which are also seeing a new increase. This suggests the possibility of a global component to the trend.  
8.4 About half the rise in robbery and knife/gun crime is due to improvements in police recording. For the remainder, drug-related cases seem to be an important driver. Between 2014/15 and 2016/17, homicides where either the victim or suspect were known to be involved in using or dealing illicit drugs increased from 50% to 57%.  
8.5 Crack cocaine markets have strong links to serious violence and evidence suggests crack use is rising in England and Wales. This is probably driven by supply and demand factors. For supply, cocaine production and purity have soared. 


For demand, there was a 14% increase in the number of people presenting to treatment services with crack cocaine problems between 2015/16 and 2016/17. Drug-related cases also seem to be one of the driving factors in the homicide increase in the US.  
8.6 Drug-market violence may also be facilitated and spread to some extent by social media. A small minority are using social media to glamorise the gang or drug-selling life, taunt rivals and normalise carrying of weapons.  
8.7 There is no evidence that falls in stop and search are driving this trend. Research evidence suggests the police should focus on increasing the likelihood that offenders are caught, and improved targeting of known offenders and hot-spot locations.  
8.8 There is evidence of considerable overlap between victims and offenders of serious violence. The rise may also therefore be related to increases in certain vulnerable groups like the homeless and excluded children. This is not to say that homelessness or being excluded necessarily causes violence, but that these are markers for being at higher risk of becoming a victim or offender.  
8.9 National Policy is outlined in the serious violence strategy and outlines the key factors in effective intervention for youth violence.  
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachm ent_data/file/698009/serious-violence-strategy.pdf  
	9 	Oldham's Response  
	9.1 	The key relevant points for Oldham's response are: 
• Targeted preventative interventions, focussing on individuals who are at risk of violence (either as perpetrator or victim) show the best value for money and evidence of success 
• School and home environments are identified as the most effective contexts from which to develop responses, it is not however clear which is the most effective  
• A multi modal approach that addresses the full complexity of a young person's experience is clearly identified as the most effective response 
• Intensity of the programme should be adjusted according to the risk levels. Highly intensive programmes show good evidence of effectiveness with high risk young people but are less effective when used with medium or low risk cases.  
a. Youth Now will support the development of a targeted intervention programme that works with schools identified as at particular risk of youth violence to target young people within them that are categorised as 'high risk'. Although the offer will be working with these schools, the school will not be the only context interventions are working with (see Figure 1) and a multi model response will be central to Youth Now practice.  





10 Intelligence Led Delivery  
10.1 Effective targeting of delivery is a key factor in testing the concept of this model and achieving the objectives of desistance and keeping young people safe. 
10.2 In order to identify the most appropriate locations to work within, data has been reviewed from schools themselves (through the council's Business Intelligence Service), alongside data from the Youth Justice Service, the MASH (CSC and Early Help contacts) and Greater Manchester Police. The data was analysed through a multiagency lens, and cross referenced with intelligence and information about the locality/neighbourhoods which the schools are located in. 
10.3 There are 6 secondary schools which are consistently highlighted within the data as having problematic issues with youth violence.  
• Oldham Academy North 
• Royton and Crompton 
• Newman College 
• Failsworth Co-op Academy 
• Waterhead Academy 
• Oasis Academy 
10.4 Each of these schools would benefit from the Youth Now model, however based upon wider information and intelligence, both current and historic, it has been determined that the Youth Now model should initially be piloted in Failsworth Co-op Academy and Royton and Crompton School. 
10.5 The number of youth people being referred to services who are engaged in, or at significant risk of serious youth violence, who have previously attended Failsworth Coop Academy and who live in the locality, is consistent year on year. The tracking of young people who have been the subject of managed moves or permanent exclusions for violence related behaviours frequently shows the Academy as the original educational establishment attended by the young people. It is therefore anticipated that if the model is successful, in addition to reducing incidences of serious youth violence, there will be a reduction in the numbers of young people who are subject to managed moves and/or exclusions. 
10.6 Royton and Crompton School is slightly different as many of the students, who the project will be targeted towards do not live within the locality of the school. It is recognised that many young people transition to this secondary school from primary schools in the Derker and Littlemoor areas. Examination of the primary school data from these areas shows a higher level of violence being perpetrated in these schools than in others in the borough. The Youth Now offer within the community would therefore need to be differentiated to allow for wider work within those communities. 
10.7 Royton and Crompton School has also been selected by Greater Manchester Police to have a full time Campus Police Officer due to the behaviours occurring with the students from the school. 
10.8 Additional Police Officers have been allocated to work with other schools across the borough. Whilst not allocated to specific schools they will work in partnership and there will be intrinsic links between the MASH, the existing prevention offer from Positive Steps and the Detached Youth Service. This will ensure that the four secondary schools not part of the initial Youth Now roll out will still receive a robust offer. Any early learning identified from the Youth Now project will also be cascaded to work within the wider borough. 
	11 	Monitoring Outcomes and Evaluation: Evidence of Impact 
11.1 The outcomes of Youth Now will be monitored in several ways. Intelligence and data sets will be gathered across the partnership to include Police, Criminal Justice, Education and Health. In addition to this will be the soft qualitative data analysis which will be gathered from those directly involved in the assessments and subsequent interventions and will focus on the change in thinking, attitudes and values over the course of programme engagement.  
11.2 Internal evaluation reports will be produced and shared with the partnership on a quarterly basis, in addition to an annual report which will track progress and evidence the impact of the approach against the overall aims.  We are currently in discussions with The University of Bedfordshire to develop an external evaluation framework, led by Dr Carlene Firmin. Dr Firmin is an expert in contextual safeguarding and has previously been commissioned by the Oldham LSCB to chair a multi-agency case review. Working with Dr Firmin on this project will enable a continuum of the previous work within the partnership to embed and support her recommendations for the development of contextualised safeguarding models.
