The Youth Justice Plan describes strategic priorities in the context of current and projected performance against the national outcomes. This document also contains the Lambeth Building Brighter Futures Improvemnet Strategy: Phase 2.
 
 	 
 
Foreword 
 
 
On behalf of the Lambeth Youth Justice Partnership Board I am pleased to present the Lambeth Youth Justice Plan 2019 - 2021. 
 
It builds on the very significant improvement process in 2017-19 under the Building Brighter Futures Strategy and is informed by the outcomes of the HMIP Joint Inspection of Lambeth Youth offending services published in April 2019. Our key focus in 2018-19 has been completing the Improvement Strategy "Building Brighter Futures". The three key areas of focus of this strategy in 2017-19 were:   
1. The delivery model 
2. The offer to young people 
3. Partnerships and Governance  
 
Board maintained commitment to and close scrutiny of the plan over the two years. Board is clear that all the effort is now showing in the key performance measures. The HMIP Inspection (published April 2019) noted the positive outcomes of that work. We had also drawn on external scrutiny, including from the YJB, to make sure the outcomes were achieved. In constructing this plan we have done much more extensive co-production with staff, partners and community groups. 
 
The key issues for the Partnership Board in the next Phase are: 
a) Completion of the HMIP Action Plan recommendations  
b) Sustain our focus on improving Keep Performance Indicator Performance and therefore on practice development in the partnership 
c) Update our Governance processes now that we are an improving partnership. This includes our reporting to other Lambeth strategic Boards.  	d) Incorporate the new YJB National Standards into Board processes 
 	e) Sustain our learning about effective and emerging practice from staff, partners and from other areas, including inspection outcomes 
 
 
The Youth Justice Partnership Board commends this Youth Justice Plan, which sets out the next phase of the Building Brighter Futures Strategy. The YJPB acknowledges the commitment of staff and partners over the two year improvement programme which has resulted in a demonstrably better service for young people.

Legal Context 
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (Section 40) sets out responsibilities placed upon the YOT partnership in relation to the production of an annual Youth Justice (YJ) Plan. It states that it is the statutory duty for each local authority, after consultation with the partner agencies, to formulate and implement an annual youth justice plan setting out: 
• How Youth Justice Services in their area are to be provided and funded; 
• How the YOS will be composed and funded, how it will operate, and what functions it will carry out. 
The guidance requires the plan to address the following themes: 
Introduction
(Including a brief review of last years' plan)Structure and GovernanceResources and 
Value for MoneyPartnership ArrangementsRisks to future Delivery
 
 
The Lambeth Youth Justice Plan 2019-21 also sets out the next stage of the building Brighter Futures Improvement Strategy which has provided the framework for Youth Justice Services in Lambeth.   
 
Review of 2018/19 

Services for young people in contact with the youth justice system in Lambeth had for a considerable period of time encountered difficulties. Inspections by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation in 2011 and 2015 raised serious concerns about the quality of practice and structural service issues. Shortly after the YOS moved into Children's Services in 2017, it was recognised that progress had been limited as there were entrenched systemic challenges especially in relation to staffing, which had hindered the ability to realise sustained change. Consequently, the Lambeth Youth Justice Partnership Board and Lambeth Borough Council launched a comprehensive improvement strategy which became known as Building Brighter Futures. The strategy had three interlocking elements: 
(a) Developing a clear approach to working with young people  (b) Redesigning the delivery model  (c) Strengthening the wider partnership and Governance  
This comprehensive programme successfully achieved improvements within the Youth Offending Service particularly with a focus on ensuring that there was strategic buy-in across the partnership. During the last two years attention was given to ensuring that the service established a high-quality workforce, supported by robust management and training, The complex process of re-design continued into 2018 with further changes at both leadership and operational levels resulting in a significant reduction in the level of agency staff utilised within the Service. There was a risk that leadership changes could have destabilised the service however to the credit of the professionals involved there was no loss of momentum as acknowledged by HMIP Inspectors: 
'.......despite changes in personnel, the service improvement plan has been followed consistently.' (HMIP 2019). 
In October 2018 an independent expert commissioned by the YJB at the request of the Lambeth Youth Justice Partnership, conducted a review of Lambeth out of court disposal arrangements and reported positively on the quality of the service offer and the impact it was starting to achieve. 
'It is my professional opinion that the process in Lambeth for gathering information via YOS, police and partner agencies for use in the meeting is of a very high standard. I have no hesitation in stating that the processes undertaken (both pre- and during the meeting) to gather and share information could be held as examples of good practice.'  (Youth Justice Board scoping visit to Lambeth Youth Offending Service with regards to First Time Entrant data, November 2018). 
 
 
 
The Building Brighter Futures strategy was supported by a detailed Improvement Plan running alongside the Youth Justice Plan and this determined the activity during 2018/19, the highlights of which are summarised below: 

 
 
HMIP Joint Inspection 
 In February 2019 a joint inspection of Lambeth Youth Justice services was undertaken by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation and their partner inspectorates which reported in April 2019 and judged that local arrangements 'required improvement'.  The report acknowledged that much had been achieved since the previous two inspections that had found the service and partnership to be 'inadequate' and  
'This inspection, however, found a high level of commitment to prioritising improvement and maintaining the necessary resources' (HMIP 2019). 
The final report following the Joint Inspection by HMIP made the following recommendations that: 
The Youth Justice Partnership Board should: 
1. Make sure that protocols across the partnership are consistently applied and understood at operational level so that risk management, assessment, decision-making and service provision are based on information from all agencies 
2. Monitor all young people with education, health and care plans to ensure that they have their identified additional needs met, especially for those children and young people who are in transition from custody to the community 
3. Further enhance universal health and wellbeing screening to all children and young people on court orders. 
The YOS Head of Service should: 
4. Accurately assess the risk to a child or young person's safety and wellbeing and risk of harm to others, and make sure that all risks are reviewed and managed effectively 
5. Develop victim and restorative justice processes to meet the needs of potential and actual victims, and ensure that opportunities for restorative justice are fully considered in every relevant case 
6. Capture the views of children and young people, their parents or carers and other stakeholders so that they can influence future service delivery. 
The HMIP Action Plan to address the recommendations can be found in Appendix 1.  
 
 
 
Moving Forward - Building Brighter Futures: Phase Two  
The joint inspection in 2019 coincided with the conclusion of the initial two-year Building Brighter Futures improvement strategy established in 2017.  The Youth Justice Partnership Board agreed to sustain the Building Brighter Futures 'branding' associated with Phase One as it signified the continued determination to improvement. Phase one focussed on establishing stability and formulating the building blocks of improvement, Phase Two will have a more refined focus on improving outcomes for children and their families and the recommendations outlined in the 2019 HMIP inspection. 
Building Brighter Futures set out to address inequality and disproportionality in the system, the Practice Framework supports culturally sensitive and individually tailored interventions to meet the specific needs of individuals and encourages staff to understand and engage with all, including in relation to issues of identity and culture.  In Phase Two the attention given to these important objectives will be intensified. There will be a particular focus on those children and young people who are affected by systemic inequalities within society.  Disproportionality within the youth justice cohort of young people, particularly black young men remains significant.  The YOS will work alongside wider borough strategies such as 'Raising the Game' which aims to tackle the 7-10% academic attainment gap and disproportionately high exclusion rates experienced by Black Caribbean pupils in the borough.  It is a priority that interventions are relevant and responsive to the needs of all young people. The service will work closely with community organisations, parents and carers, ensuring that staff, through ongoing training, are appropriately skilled. 
Due to the increasing levels of criminal exploitation, interventions will take into consideration that children and young people are often simultaneously both perpetrators and victims of crime and therefore trauma informed practices remain integral to service delivery and will be further enhanced.  It is acknowledged that there is a need to provide interventions at the earliest opportunity and this will require even more effort to work closely with a range of partners especially in early help and preventative services. The YOS is an integral partner in the formulation of the borough-wide strategy to tackle serious violence which will be underpinned by the public health model including measures to support young black men who are disproportionately affected by this issue. 
The next phase of improvement provides an opportunity to strengthen these links and support innovative responses for individuals and the wider community. These objectives will be underpinned by a strength-based model of practice, working closely with key agencies, both statutory and in local communities to ensure that service delivery has been underpinned by the views and opinions of those who receive these services. 
Mechanisms have been implemented within the service to oversee the quality of practice and ensure that standards are adhered to. These will be further strengthened including through the newly established Performance and Quality Assurance Group which will report to the Children's Services Strategy and Performance Board and the Youth Justice Partnership Board. 
The revised National Standards for Youth Justice were introduced in April 2019.  The National Standards for Children in the Youth Justice System provide both strategic and operational services with a clear understanding of the expectations for practitioners and the partnership at each stage of a child's journey through the justice system. The permeating principle throughout the revised Standards is to view children and young people as a 'child first, offender second'. The revised standards place an emphasis on achieving positive outcomes for children rather than being primarily process-driven requirements. This aligns well with the principles upon which Building Brighter Futures was built and can be seen reflected in the Practice Framework and the policies revised during phase one. The YJB requires that all YOS undertake a self-assessment audit to gauge readiness for the implementation and compliance of the revised National Standards to be undertaken by March 2020. This will be conducted in conjunction with the YJPB, the service and partners. 
 	 

The Strategic Model 
Building Brighter Futures key aim is working collaboratively to analyse local issues and design sustainable solutions through meaningful participation at all levels. The development of this Youth Justice Plan has modelled the principles of co-production through a series of consultation and participation events with staff, service managers and partners from statutory agencies and community organisations. There are clearly identifiable golden threads from stakeholders which set its sights clearly on improving outcomes through a relentless focus on best practice across youth justice services reflected in high levels of performance. The four streams of activity and the maintenance of a robust infrastructure will support and build on the previous improvement strategy.  
> Continuing the development of well organised and supported governance and decisive leadership arrangements.  
> Developing and retaining a highly skilled and motivated workforce building on the service re-design including retention and responding to the natural turnover of staff. 
> Working closely with partners especially community and voluntary sector organisations to maximise opportunities to meet the needs, address the risks associated with vulnerable and sustained outcomes. 
The fourth stream 'Communication' gives more prominence to a wide range of activity including developing the meaningful participation of service users in developing and improving services. Youth justice services are often not well understood and is often shrouded from view leading to inaccurate assumptions and beliefs that can have a detrimental impact on achieving positive outcomes for children. This stream incorporates engagement with service users and partners in creating and promoting a more positive narrative around the service, the local youth justice system and crucially with respect to children and young people.  
Underlying the activity streams will be a number of key infrastructure projects to ensure the facilities and resources needed by the service to deliver its objectives are robust. These will include enhancing the use of data, developing more clearly defined channel of communication and the completion of the project to move front line delivery to new bespoke premises. The model is illustrated in the diagram below:  

The collaborative approach taken in developing the Youth Justice Plan and Phase Two of Building Brighter Futures has resulted in a rich and extensive range of ideas, initiatives and projects which will be set out in a detailed Service Delivery Plan. These detailed actions can be traced to a number of sources including the HMIP report, consultation with staff, partners and service users and items brought forward from Phase One of the Improvement Strategy. 
Through the consultation process some high-level priorities have been identified in addition to the recommendations from HMIP all of which will be prominent in the Service Delivery Plan and can be summarised as follows: 
o Reducing Serious Youth Violence o Tackling discrimination and disproportionality o Developing a strategy for communication with a range of audiences including children, families and communities o Working effectively with communities using data and intelligence to steer continuous improvement in end to end service delivery. 
o Making best use of resources through creativity and innovation o Improving performance against national and local indicators o Implementing National Standards 2019 
These priority themes cut across the various streams of the model outlined above and will help to shape the improvements in practice and performance which in turn will promote better outcomes for children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Understanding our children - the young people who come into contact with the youth justice system in Lambeth  
Lambeth is a diverse, vibrant inner London borough with a population exceeding 318,000 making it the fifth most densely populated borough nationally. There are 67,900 children aged 0-19 with 25,000 being 10-17 year olds.  
 
Over the last two years the range and quality of data available to the Youth Justice Partnership and YOS has expanded allowing greater clarity on the key issues facing children in the borough and aiding service development.  Overall recorded crime in Lambeth has remained stable for the last four years but with some important trends evident: 
• Total overall increase in violent crime with a reduction in non-violence offences.  
• Violence Against the Person - Lambeth was 3rd highest borough in London, however there was a 5.4% reduction last year. 
• Youth violence peaked in 2017 and reduced in 2018. There was a  48% fall in Serious Youth Violence (SYV) offences over 12 months and Lambeth is 11th of London boroughs 
• Knife related crime fell compared to other London boroughs  however gun crime remains relatively high, but largely an adult driven offence ? Drug offences - 8.5% rise in drug offences in past 12 months, influenced by a long established drugs market and county lines  ? Robbery- 10th of London boroughs. Decline of 33% of robbery offences in last 12 months.  
• Domestic Abuse - Increased by 12% in past 12 months.  
(Source: Safer Lambeth Partnership) 
In line with national trends the number of young people coming into contact with the youth justice system has reduced significantly over the last few years In consequence the number of disposals reduced by 28% with a consequential reduction in average caseloads. 
 
  
 
The profile of Lambeth YOS caseload in June 2019 

The top four crime types committed by young people known to Lambeth YOS are: Public Order, Robbery: Drugs: violence against person 
Violence against the person' offences accounted for 31% of all court disposals for young people in June 2017 
This had risen to 34% by June 2019. Serious Youth Violence remains a source of considerable concern, as well as presenting serious risks to public safety and individual victims, the safety and well-being of the young people themselves is also threatened. The numbers of black boys and young men in contact with the system in Lambeth is a major concern and is disproportionate to their representation in the community.  More analysis using the recently re-launched YJB disproportionality tracker and more consistent use of the re-offending tracker will be undertaken to deepen understanding and focus action. 
 

In 2017/18, 64% of the offending population is described as 'Black or Black British' compared to 43% in the 10 - 17 year old population (Census 2011).  
In June 2017 children from BAME groups accounted for 83% of the YOS caseload and was exactly the same figure in June 2019 despite the reductions in levels of offending. 
The HMIP report summarised the challenges that still lie ahead for local services including the YOS: 
'While the partnership makes some good use of the data, it has not yet used it to inform work to reduce disproportionality, serious youth violence or the number of looked after children in the criminal justice system.' (Inspection of youth offending services in: Lambeth, HMIP 2019). 
  
National Indicators and Targets  
These remain the principle measurement of YOS and partnership performance from which central government derives its judgements as to progress and improvement. This section of the Youth Justice Plan reports recent and current performance and sets out the targets for the coming year.  There are three national performance indicators. 
* Reducing First Time Entrants 
* Reducing the rate of re-offending 

In the year to June 2017 there were 148 First Time Entrants (FTE) to the Youth justice system in Lambeth. In the 12 months to December 2018 there were 115. The rate per 100,000 as seen in the graph above has reduced by 32.4% compared to Jan 2017 to December 2017. By comparison the numbers coming into contact with the system formally for the first time is still higher in Lambeth than all comparators. Consequently reducing FTE remains a high priority across the partnership and more work is needed to fully explore the effectiveness of the system and fully utilising   universal and Early Help services to intervene before children formally enter the youth justice system. 
Key Actions for 2019/20: 
• Increasing partnership  and collaboration with  existing community services to create preventive programme   
• Continuation of  FTE work-stream led by the Early Help Partnership 
• Further development of DIVERT Youth programme in Walworth and Brixton custody suites 

In June 2017 there were 19 children serving custodial sentences. In June 2019 there were 9, a reduction of 53%. In June 2017 there were 16 children on remand in Youth Detention Accommodation. In June 2019 there were 3 young people, an 81% reduction and a significant cost saving to the local authority who are responsible for remand placements costs. 
Key Actions for 2019/20: 
• Enhance the effectiveness of resettlement work undertaken with young person in custody ahead of their release 
• Ensuring that young people with additional social and/or educational needs are addressed for young people both whilst in custody and on release  
• Embed Partnership Agreements with Children Social Care and Education Services to ensure that young people receive a coordinator response from all services. 


Given the retrospective nature of the re-offending data the results that will be seen in national figures are already determined by the counting methodology. Local trackers will provide further less formal means of following progress and the latest analysis indicates a binary rate of approximately 38%. Maintaining good performance against the reoffending measures is an indicator that interventions are appropriately addressing the needs of young people. The re-offending figures in the last two years have improved although Lambeth YOS has been placed in the bottom quartile of all London comparators for the last six quarters, and has not performed as well as other statistical neighbours. The figures have not shown the same level of improvement as those for FTE and use of custody indicators, however, it should be noted that both the latter indicators report performance since the YOS improvement programme began in 2017, whereas the re-offending data covers performance that was largely prior to that date. 
Key Actions for Improvement: 
• Accurately assess the risk to a child or young person's safety and wellbeing and risk of harm to others, and make sure that all risks are reviewed and managed effectively. 
• Broaden the scope of health screening at the beginning of an order enabling better signposting, care planning and risk management. 
• Provide consistent and effective service leadership and management to ensure high quality practice and a confident workforce 
• Developing a comprehensive menu of interventions that addresses the identified offending profile within Lambeth YOS and incorporating evaluation mechanism. 
• Develop victim and restorative justice processes to meet the needs of potential and actual victims, and ensure that opportunities for restorative justice are fully considered in every relevant case.  
• Enhance the participation of children, their parents or carers and other stakeholders so that they influence service delivery and policy.  
• Ensure that the strategies for addressing serious violence and disproportionality follow the public health model and are clearly understood and implemented 	16
 	  
Local Indicators and Targets 
 

 
 
The Lambeth Youth Justice Partnership Board have agreed to keep a local indicator on Education, Training and Employment in recognition of the vital role that plays in promoting desistance and safeguarding children and the wider community. This local indicator is reported to the Youth Justice Partnership Board which commissioned a specific analysis of ETE and the YOS cohort during 2018/19 which led to the formulation of a Partnership Agreement and other activities aimed at improving the attendance and attainment of children in education settings.  This appears to have had a positive impact on the engagement of school aged children in particular although the results for those aged over 16 are less positive and remain a focus for activity moving forward. 
 
Key Actions for 2019/20: 
• Full and active attention given to the education, training and employment arrangements for every child throughout the order or intervention. 
• To ensure that every child EHC Plan receives a coordinated package of support which is robustly implemented and monitored with a focus on those in custody. 
• Review information sharing protocols so that they promote consistency and shared understanding. ? 	Developing further innovative strategies to engage with ETE providers for 16-18 year olds    
Governance  
For the last three years the Lambeth Youth Justice Partnership has had an independent chair which, as the HMIP report acknowledged has been a critical factor in the significant improvements achieved locally. The current Chair will step down in July 2019 and the chairing will become the joint responsibility of the 
Strategic Director for Children's Services of Lambeth Borough Council and the Superintendent, Metropolitan Police Services, Lambeth and Southwark BCU. This change recognises the progress made supporting local leaders to drive the next phase of improvement. The YJPB has representatives from the statutory partners and community groups. HMIP acknowledged the strength of the Governance provided by the Board. Changes to Board chairing arrangements and membership will ensure continuity of focus and broadening of engagement by key stakeholders such as housing and education. The revised YJB national standards will require the Board to provide further challenge and support to ensure the following elements are met: 
Systems  
1. Quality-assurance systems built on feedback from key stakeholders including courts, victims, children, parents and carers. 
2. Records and information held on children in custodial establishments is available and accessible to those who need it - to make sure there is the proper co-ordination of services to support children when they are in custody and   when they are released. 
3. Identify and generate management information - including passing this securely to the YJB or the youth custody service 
 
Management boards should implement clear and specific youth justice local policies and protocols covering:  
1. Provision of persons to act as appropriate adults to safeguard the interests of children detained or questioned by police officers in line with the National Appropriate Adult Network's National Standards 
2. Provision for children who may be interviewed under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) while remanded or sentenced in youth detention accommodation whether within or outside the local authority area 
3. Service to victims in line with the Code of practice for victims of crime 
4. The quality of case management 
5. Public protection and desistance policies (including release and recall arrangements for children on license/supervision)  
6. Engagement and compliance with court orders, remand and bail programmes, including responsibilities for undertaking enforcement action where case management sits outside the YOS. 
Lambeth YOS has implemented mechanisms that will ensure that there are clear lines of accountability between the Board and the recently established Quality and Performance Group to ensure the Board and service functions efficiently. Board meetings routinely review risks to achievement of goals. The analysis and challenge leads to targeted work. The Board is also implementing processes which increases Board members' understanding of the operational work within the YOS which enhances support and challenge. The work of the Youth Justice Partnership Board reports to the Safer Lambeth Partnership and is subject to review by the Scrutiny Committees of the Council. Board briefings ensure Board members are updated on local, London wide and national youth justice developments. 
 
Financial Resources  
The budget for 2019/20 has been established at £ 2.9 million.  The Ministry of Justice (via the Youth Justice Board) have awarded a core grant of £570.283, which is controlled within the Lambeth YOS budget arrangements and are used exclusively for the delivery of youth justice services as per the headlines below. 
Contributing to the 'pooled' budget for staffing, premises and delivery of interventions.Supporting training and development of staff and volunteers.Ensuring compliance with data recording and information exchange expectations.The MoJ also awards a grant to the local authority to support remands to Youth Detention Accommodation, which in 2019/20 will be £452,544. This grant is managed within the placements budgets of children's social care. All additional resources and funding bids, including those for youth justice are managed centrally by the Safer Lambeth (Community Safety) Partnership. A breakdown of the financial resources can be found in Appendix 2.   
Structure 
There are significant challenges recruiting and retaining staff in London, however, progress has been made and the service has ensured that the calibre and experience of those appointed has been high. This success in recruitment is one indication that Lambeth YOS is increasingly seen as an attractive service to be part of. This has been reflected in both the recruitment of YOS staff and Youth Offender Panel members. 
The wider process of transformation also addressed issues of workforce leadership, culture, organisational development, employee development and building a qualified and skilled workforce. The improvements acknowledged during the inspection owe much to the investment in this wide ranging approach and the tenacity shown by all involved to keep on course despite the challenges. For example, the inspectors noted that: 
'Managers appreciated the clear and open leadership from senior managers, and despite changes in personnel, the service improvement plan has been followed consistently' (HMIP, 2019) 
The team is now established in the refurbished Civic Centre which has supported closer working with colleagues in social care, education and community safety as well as other council run services. The YOS will be moving into a new, children and young person-centred premises in the autumn of 2019 where the majority of frontline delivery will be conducted. A successful move to Bromley Youth Court in autumn 2018 has led to improved relationships with judges, magistrates and other court users who have a better understanding of the work of Lambeth YOS and what the service is trying to achieve.  
The YOS structure chart as at June 2019 is reproduced below. 

Training Priorities  
The Building Brighter Futures improvement strategy Phase One drove an extensive training programme to support the re-design of the service. This included a revised induction framework and a focus on understanding critical, often traumatic factors in a child's life through techniques of psychological formulation and analysis. This was underpinned by a Practice Framework developed by staff working in the service, increasingly rigorous supervision and appraisal and the continuation of a highly valued process of clinical supervision provided by an external therapist. 
 
The priorities for training in the life of this Youth Justice Plan have been identified from the HMIP report and through consultation with staff working within the service but also take into account partnership priorities that extend beyond the work of the YOS.  
 
The headline priorities for training will be: 
 

 
Underpinning the work of the YOS is competency in using the case management systems and data reporting mechanisms. Ongoing training will be scheduled for new and existing staff across the service irrespective of role or grade to enhance overall ability in this area. Tackling disproportionality will be a thread that runs through all training and development activity such as Unconscious Bias training to ensure that this priority issue maintains a visible and decisive profile for staff, partners and service users. 
 
The service will continue to have access to safeguarding training delivered under the auspices of the Lambeth Children's Safeguarding Board and to wider children's service training such as 'Children at the Heart of Practice' and joint leadership training for managers. Opportunities at a local and regional level will be utilised such as through the YJB and sector led components of the national Workforce Development Strategy. The YJPB will also develop mechanisms for ensuring Board members are engaged in relevant training and work with practitioners on these themes.  
 
Partnership Arrangements  
* The YOS is a member of the Lambeth Safeguarding Children's Board. Building upon the work that taken place over the last 12 months relating to the Young People at Risk, the Head of Service will continue to be actively involved in the development of Lambeth's Serious Youth Violence Partnership Strategy. This strategy will focus on the vulnerability and safeguarding of children, young people and young adults affected by serious violence and the related issues such as criminal exploitation and county lines. The YOS will continue to be represented at the MASE panel that considers children at risk of child sexual exploitation and criminal exploitation.  
 
* Since the inspection there has been renewed attention on continuing to develop relationships with Children's Social Care and embed the revised YOS and Children's Social Care Partnership Agreement; this has included joint training and cross service information sharing forums.  Stronger links have been established with the Integrated Referral Hub with the YOS attending daily multi agency intelligence briefings, which provides more robust safeguarding of children.  
* The service will work with colleagues in the Council's Education Learning and Skills teams to embed the Partnership Agreement in order to improve information exchange and working arrangements.  Closer working will improve outcomes for young people by supporting school attendance, reducing exclusion and the early identification of any SEN.  Building upon this, the YOS Education Worker is making contact with school and colleges to develop better communication and joint working opportunities. 
* There have been important developments in the relationships with community based organisations such as 'Black Thrive', the 'Young Lambeth Cooperative' and 'Lambeth Made'. There will be new arrangements for targeted youth services coming on line in the next few months and the YOS will establish strong links to continue the progress made.  Community groups are central to local strategies for tackling serious violence, exploitation and disproportionality which are priority issues for youth justice services.  Reparation and group programmes have developed in conjunction with third sector providers, which will be further developed. 
* The YOS has 2 Police Officers and one Police Sergeant co-located within the team. Police colleagues undertake extensive intelligence checks on each person known to the YOS and attend the YOS Risk Management Panel to contribute to assessments and plans. In addition, they take a lead role in the Joint Decision- Making Panel for Out of Court Disposals which is attended by a range of agencies including; Early Help, Liaison and Diversion, Children's 
Social Care and the YOS Victim Coordinator. The YOS is also working collaboratively with colleagues across the Lambeth and Southwark Police Borough Command Unit in relation to developments and good practice models. This has included reviewing the interventions and services provided to children and young people in police custody such as the multi-agency 'Why you? Why today?' knife initiative pilot scheme. 
* The HMIP report noted that "The service has a very well-resourced health and wellbeing team, who have a clear understanding of the positive impact of good health provision". Further work to enhance the coverage of this important component of the local service is underway in line with HMIP recommendations.  A Liaison and Diversion post has been established the main function of this role is to ensure the emotional wellbeing of young people whilst detained in custody and to undertake the screening of young people and carry out assessments where required. The location of this practitioner in the custody suite means that regardless of whether charged or not, the needs of all young people will be considered. This intervention provides an opportunity for diversion services to be offered. It also ensures that those with high-level presenting needs receive a timely mental health assessment and are referred to appropriate services. The liaison and diversion practitioners works closely with the Youth DIVERT programme which provides community interventions to young people who have been arrested. This further compliments the heath offer within the service which includes CAMHS, GP services and DASH. 
* A key area of work for the YOS is ensuring the smooth transition for those young people who will transition to adult services, especially those who are transferred to Probation. There was a gap in service provision due to having the seconded Probation post being vacant, the service has now successfully recruited to this post. 
* Key Actions 
• YOS will lead the Response and Support Strand of the Borough wide SYV Strategy developing interventions for children most at risk of SYV. 
• Embedding the Partnership Agreements between the YOS and Education Learning and Skills and with Children's Social Care 
• Enhancing the use of local projects and organisations to deliver services to young people in the local community 
• Extending the coverage and reach of the Health offer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The voice of the child and family  
It is imperative that the users of youth justice services voices are considered within service design and delivery. There is a need to be creative and committed to ensuring that young people (and their parents/carers) have the opportunity to contribute to service developments and to have their voice heard.  The service therefore aims to: 
• Building greater opportunities for participation of young people, families and victims of crime 
• Embedding a culture that supports and values participation 
• Ensure the voice of young people, families and victims is known to decision makers and influences service delivery 
Lambeth YOS developed a plan for increasing participation under the 'Communication' stream of Building Brighter Futures.  Work to date has included young people contributing to the internal design of the front line delivery venue, undertaking a survey of their views on serious youth violence and working with Speech and Language Therapists to design information leaflets for those appearing in court. 
More recently an 'end of intervention' survey has been implemented which aims to gather the experiences of children as they move on from YOS intervention and will provide Lambeth YOS with feedback which can improve service delivery. The YOS Health Worker routinely collects information from young people through an on-line assessment process which includes their views on issues such as youth violence. For the past two years the YOS has had a presence at the prestigious Lambeth Country Show, in 2019 working alongside Safer Lambeth and others as part of the strategy to tackle serious violence.  
There have been significant developments in working with parents, with a number of groups running that have been established following feedback from participants. 
Key Actions 
* Develop clearer processes so that feedback is collected systematically from all children and young people working with the service 
* Ensure the inclusion of YOS service users in wider participation activities such as 'Lambeth Made' and through Early Help 
* Increase the participation of parents and carers and ensure feedback is routinely collected and acted upon 
 
 
 
 
Risks to Delivery 
The programme of activity planed in the forthcoming two years is complex and wide ranging and risks may arise that threaten progress and the achievement of the objectives outlined above. These can be broken down as described below and within the detailed activities set out in the Service Delivery Plan will be actions that seek to prevent such risks arising. 
Governance 
• Partners do not sufficiently engage nor identify barriers to improvement and do not actively seek creative solutions to challenges therefore resulting in Key performance indicators failing to sustain improvements. 
• Statutory functions of the Partnership Board are not fulfilled, losing opportunities to influence and utilise partnership activity. 
• Opportunities for learning remain underdeveloped due to lack of capacity therefore missing chances to increase effectiveness. 
 
Leadership and Staffing 
• Managers fail to deliver transparent, consistent and well communicated advice and support which drives outcomes-focussed activity ? The inability to recruit and/or retain suitable calibre of staff and volunteers 
• Suitable training not available or undertaken by staff and volunteers 
 
Partnership Working 
• Key partners do not effectively engage with key issues such as exclusion, inequalities and disproportionality.  
• Lack of clarity leads to preoccupation with processes and inter-agency functions resulting in duplication and confusion for professionals and service users 
• Secure establishments do not engage with community services to implement robust sentence and post-sentence plans 
 
Services 
• Restorative approaches not given embedded 
• Lack of clarity and/or capacity regarding use of data means service are not developed in an intelligent way that best addresses the risks and needs of the cohort and wider community. 
• Children/young people and their families are not sufficiently engaged in consultation processes. 
 
 
 	 

 
 Appendix 1 HMIP Action Plan  
 
Recommendation Action  1. Make sure that protocols across the partnership are consistently applied and understood at operational level so that risk management, assessment, decision-making and service provision are based on information from all agencies The Inspection report focuses on protocols with CSC and Education. Board agrees that these are the two priority areas. Other protocols may be developed. The Performance and Quality Assurance group in collaboration with partners will report via Head of Service to Board on proposals for 
- Planned development work 
- Any strategic barriers Board should address 
- Monitoring and reporting to Board 2.Monitor all young people with education, health and care plans to ensure that they have their identified additional needs met, especially for those children and young people who are in transition from custody to the community Board will set up a Task and Finish group to undertake this including CSC, Education, Health and Probation Board members. This group will 
- Undertake baseline analysis 
- assess current practice 
- propose new practice informed by national guidance and best practice 3. Further enhance universal health and wellbeing screening to all children and young people on court orders. Board members with Health remit will be commissioned to review current data and provision and make proposals to the partnership on enhanced screening for young people on Court Orders. 4.Accurately assess the risk to a child or young person's safety and wellbeing and risk of harm to others, and make sure that all risks are reviewed and managed effectively The following will be implemented: 
- 	Staff will receive refresher training on the assessment of safety and well-being and risk of harm to others. - Performance and quality assurance processes will be reviewed, and additional mechanisms implemented. 
- Embedding the joint protocols with Children Social Care and Education to ensure the triangulation of information and response to identified risks. 
- Embed the learning from a peer YOS in relation to their areas of good practice. 5.Develop victim and restorative justice processes to meet the needs of potential and actual victims, and ensure that opportunities for restorative justice are fully considered in every relevant case The following will be implemented: 
- The victim and restorative justice processes and procedures will be reviewed. 
- Staff will receive refresher training on restorative justice to ensure that where appropriate the opportunity to implement RJ is utilised throughout the intervention. 
- Work will be developed in partnership with partner agencies to increase the opportunities to engage with RJ processes. 6. Capture the views of children and young people, their parents or carers and other stakeholders so that they can influence future service delivery. The following will be implemented: 
- Systematic processes will be implemented to ensure that children / young people and their parent/carers views are captured both in relation to the interventions that they have received and any service and policies changes within the YOS. This will include the establishment of a YOS youth consultation group. 
- That service user's and stakeholder feedback (both statutory and community) informs future service plans and delivery which will be incorporated through reporting mechanisms to the Youth Justice Partnership Board.
